<p class='listHeader'><b>Earning an 'A'</b>: Notice that the criteria above are for an <em>A-</em>
not an <em>A</em>.  To earn a "straight" A, you must meet the criteria for an A- <em>and</em> 
get an 85% or better on the final exam.


<!----
There is no set criteria for an A. 
In addition to meeting all the criteria for an A- (given in the table above), students who earn an 'A' students must
also demonstrate an exceptional depth of understanding of the course material.
Students may demonstrate this depth of understanding in several  ways including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing unusually insightful answers during class discussion.
<li>Regularly earning Ms or Es on learning objectives the first time they are offered.
<li>Earning many Es on learning objectives, projects, and other assignments.
<li>Adding optional features to projects.
</ul>
-->

<p><b>+/- modifiers</b>: There will be a comprehensive final exam.  If you score 80% or higher on this exam, you will earn a "+" on your 
base grade.  If you score 60% or lower, you will earn a "-".  The final exam has no other effect on your course grade.  I may add a plus or minus to a course grade for other reasons at my discretion.  For example, i reserve the right to add a "-" to your grade for excessive absences.  Note:  GVSU does not award grades of A+ or D-.</p>

<p><b>Learning Objectives</b>:  Learning Objectives are skills that students are expected to aquire by the end of the course.  Most learning objectives will be assessed using test/quiz questions; a few will be assessed as part of a lab, project, or homework.  Learning objectives will be scored with either "M" for "Master" or "P" for "Progressing".  Students earn an “M” when they have clearly demonstrated a thorough understanding of the learning objective (e.g., answer the related test questions without any mistakes --- or perhaps a very trivial mistake like a math error).  Students earn "P" if their work indicates that they have a partial, but useful understanding of the topic (e.g., their answer is structured correctly, correctly applies the fundamentals, but has missing or incorrect details). </p> 

<p><b>Core Learning Objectives</b>: Several learning targets are classified as "Core" learning objectives.  These represent the course's most important, fundamental concepts.  Students must master these concepts to pass the course.</p>

<p><b>EMPX</b>: Most submissions (other than test/quiz questions and homework) will be scored using the EMPX metric.  (See the 
<a href='#empx'>diagram</a> below.)  A mark of "E" or "M" indicates that the submission is complete and clearly demonstrates that the student understands the relevant concepts.  A mark of "P" indicates that the student is making progress, but the assignment require additional work/revision.  A mark of "X" not sufficiently complete to assess.</p>

<p><b>Projects</b>: There are three main aspects to project submissions:  (1) They must pass the instructor-written automated tests.  (2) They must contain any reqired analysis (e.g., number of gates / running time).  (3) The circuits and other source matrial must be neatly orginzed and commented.  Projects are not evaluated until they pass the automated tests.  Once a student's project passes the automated tests, the instructior will score the presentation and analysis using the EMPX rubric.   Late days will accumulate until the project passes the automated tests and earns a mark of "E" or "M".</p>

<!-- <p><b>Labs</b>: Students are expected to be both present and on-task during the scheduled lab sessions.  (In other words, it is not acceptable to come in and work on other assignments.)  Labs will be scored using the EMPX metric. Students are expected to revise their lab submissions until they earn a mark of "E" or "M".  Labs are due at the beginning of lecture on the Monday following lab.  Students get a total of four "late tokens" per semester.  After those tokens have been exhaused, late lab submissions will not be accepted.  Students are expected to revise any submissions that receive a score of "P" or "X".  Those revisions are due two days after the instructor returns the labs.</p> -->

<p><b>Homework</b>: Homework is practice.  As such, it is expected to represent a "best effort" (i.e., be complete and thoughtful).  We will work through homework problems, and solutions will be posted within a day or two of the due date.  Therefore, students are not expected to revise and re-submit homework.  However, if a student chooses to revise any homework exercises, I will be happy to review the submission and make suggestions.</p>
