<h3>Pre-lab</h3>

<p>None this week.</p>

<h3> Overview</h3>

<p>The purpose of this lab is to provide a "hands-on" introduction to
  modern technologies for storing digital data. The lab will
  investigate basic storage device structure and function by building
  latches and experimenting with flip-flops. These simple devices
  will then be combined with combinatorial logic gates to construct
  sequential circuits. <i>Voila!</i> A state machine is born.</p>

<h3> Equipment</h3>


<p>The equipment used will be much the same as the past few weeks - with
  the addition of a few more IC's. As always, please review and
  follow the guidelines presented for working with integrated circuits.</p>

<h3> Simple Storage Devices</h3>

<p>The first and simplest storage device
  we will consider is the S-R latch. It can be constructed using
  relatively simple logic; for example, the version presented in lecture
  used two NOR gates with feedback circuits. Figure 3-1 below
  gives the logic diagram.</p>

<img class="center" src="Fig3-1.gif" height="273" width="427" alt="NOR latch">

<p><b>Important</b>: Note that the pinout of a NOR gate integrated circuit
  (74HC02) differs from the pinouts of the AND and NAND gate ICs used in
  previous labs. <!-- Figure 3-2 gives the pinout of a quad 2-input NOR
gate IC.  (Remember, this diagram shows the gate input/output to which each pin belongs.  It does <em>not</em> represent where the pins physically lie on the chip.) -->
</p>

<img class="center" src="74002.gif" alt="NOR pinout">

<p>To investigate the operation of an S-R latch, construct the
  following circuit:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Carefully insert a 74HCT02 IC into the breadboard so that each
    pin sits in its own strip.
  </li>

  <li> Connect the power supply between pins 7 and 14, with the positive
    terminal on pin 14.
  </li>

  <li> Wire the inputs and outputs of the circuit according to the
    diagram (Figure 3-1).
  </li>

  <li> Connect both the Q and Q' output lines to appropriate resistors,
    then to LEDs which are connected to ground. This will allow you to
    monitor the internal state of the latch.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Note:</b>It's a good idea to use different colored
        LEDs for the two outputs.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ol>

  <li>Demonstrate your circuit to the instructor or lab assistant.
  </li>

  <li> Notice that, unlike the combinatorial circuits we've discussed
    in class, the output of the S-R latch depends on both the inputs, and
    the current state of the device. A <em>characteristic table</em> is
    used to specify the output of the device in terms of both its input
    and current state. Determine, by observing the state of the LEDs,
    the characteristic table of the device.

    </table>
  </li>

  <li> What happens to Q and Q' when both inputs are set to logic 1?</li>
  <li> Explain how the circuit produces the observed result. (In
    other words write a couple paragraphs explaining why the output of
    this circuit makes sense given the defined behavior of its
    component gates when <code>R=1</code> and <code>S=1</code>.)
  </li>

  <li> The book claims that setting both inputs to 1 produces an "indeterminate" result.
    <ol>
      <li> Describe a specific sequence of input values for R and S that could lead to Q being in an indeterminate (or
        random), but stable, state. (Hint: Consider what happens when R and S both change values "simultaneously".)
      </li>
      <li> Describe the random state and the cause of the randomness.</li>
    </ol>
    I'm going to be very particular about how this questions is written. You will probably want to have another group
    read your answer to make sure it is clear. Note: I'm not looking for a description of any intermediate states. I'm
    only interested in final, stable, states.
  </li>
</ol>


<h3> Flip-flops</h3>

<p>As described in class, the D flip-flop is a useful device for storing
  one bit of data. It does not suffer from the indeterminate state
  observed in the S-R latch. The logic device that will be used in
  this experiment is the 74HCT74, a dual D-type flip-flop with Set and
  Reset and a positive-edge trigger. The "dual" means there are two
  D flip-flops in the IC, the "Set and Reset" means that there are pins to
  Set and Reset the device, and "positive-edge trigger" indicates that a
  bit present on the D input will be latched into the flip-flop at the
  leading edge of a clock pulse.</p>

<p>The pinout of the D flip-flop is very different from the gates used
  previously. See Figure 3-3 below for the details of the
  pinout. Power is connected across pins 7 and 14 as usual.
  For flip-flop #1, pin 2 is the D (<b>Data</b>) input. The
  outputs Q and Q' are at pins 5 and 6 respectively.
  The <b>Clock</b> signal (CLK) is input to pin 3. Finally, pin 1
  (labeled CLR) provides the Clear, or <b>Reset</b> function. Pin
  4 (labeled PR) provides the Pre-set, or <b>Set</b> function.
  Both the Set and Clear inputs are active-<em>LOW</em>, which means
  they are in effect whenever a logic 0 is applied. In other words,
  connecting Set to ground will instantly set the state of the flip-flop
  to 1. No clock pulse is necessary to use set and reset. This entire
  organization is repeated, using different pins, for flip-flop #2. </p>

<img class="center" src="74074.gif" alt="D-latch pinout">


<p class="listHeader">Construct the following circuit:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Connect power to the chip as usual and connect LEDs to monitor
    the Q and Q' outputs.
  </li>
  <li> Connect the Pre-set and Clear, and D pins to a DIP switch
    using a "pull-down" (i.e., 0 when the DIP switch is "off")
    setup. Remember, there is a page on the course web page
    showing <a href='http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~kurmasz/Teaching/Courses/General/CIS351/ReferenceDocuments/Switches/switches.html'>how to use switches</a>.
  </li>

  <li> Test your DIP switch setup by using Pre-set and Clear to set Q
    to 1, then 0.
  </li>
  <li> Connect the clock to a momentary switch using a "pull-down"
    (i.e., 0 when the switch is up, and 1 when it is pressed)
    configuration.
  </li>
  <li> Test to see that the clock and the "D" switch work as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Show the operation of the D flip-flop by completing the timing diagrams
  below: (Note: The diagrams below contain 8 vertical dotted lines.
  If you see fewer than 8 such lines, your web browser truncated the diagram.)</p>

<ol start="6">

  <li> This first diagram shows a typical clocked usage of the flip
    flop. Note that, for this diagram, PR and CLR are always 1.
    <p><img src="timing_diagram_dff_only.jpeg" alt="Diagram 1"></p></li>

  <li> This diagram shows typical preset / clear behavior. Note that
    the clock remains at 0 for the first half of the diagram.
    <p><img src="timing_diagram_dff_prclr1.jpeg" alt="Diagram 2"></p></li>

  <li> This diagram shows what happens when preset and clear are both low at the same time.
    The results of setting preset and clear to low at the same time are not defined, so the behavior may not be
    consistent.
    <p><img src="timing_diagram_dff_prclr2.jpeg" alt="Diagram 3"></p></li>
</ol>

<h3> Creating a Sequential Circuit</h3>

<p>This last experiment provides a good example of the way storage devices
  and logic gates are used together to create a sequential circuit.
  It uses a combination of feedback (the current state of a storage
  device) together with combinatorial logic to create a device
  implementing a useful function.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Construct the circuit given in Figure 3-4 below:
    <ul>
      <li> Use LEDs to monitor the Q outputs of the two flip-flops.</li>
      <li> Place the LED for A1 to the left of the LED for A0</li>
      <li><b>Note:</b> It is a good idea to wire together the
        Clear terminals of the two flip-flops. With that configuration, a
        single wire can be used to apply the active signal to both flip-flops at
        once (i.e., you can <b>Reset</b> both flip-flops simultaneously).
        Do the same thing with the two <b>Clock</b> inputs so as to synchronize
        the flip-flops on the same leading edge.
      </li>
      <!-- Again, if the effects of the "bounce" in the switches causes problems,
you will need to use a two-switch setup for your clock.</li> -->

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Use the Clear function appropriately to <b>Reset</b> the state of
    both flip-flops to Q = 0.
  </li>
  <li> Repeatedly apply <b>Clock</b> pulses to the circuit and observe
    the two Q outputs until you have discovered the pattern.
  </li>
  <li> You may need to refer to the web page showing <a href='http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~kurmasz/Teaching/Courses/General/CIS351/ReferenceDocuments/Pinouts'>pinouts</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="9">

  <li> Report your observations using a characteristic table..</li>
  <li> Based on your observations, what useful circuit have you
    constructed? Hint: Make sure your LED for A1 is to the left of the LED
    for A0.
  </li>

  <li>Demonstrate your circuit to the instructor or lab assistant.
  </li>
