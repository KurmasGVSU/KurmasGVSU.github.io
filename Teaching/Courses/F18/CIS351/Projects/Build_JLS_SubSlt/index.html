<p class="listHeader">
  Extend your signed adder from the previous project to build</p>
<ul>
  <li>a circuit than can both add and subtract, and</li>
  <li>a circuit that can compare signed and unsigned integers.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Pre-requisites</H2>

<p>You will need your signed added from the previous project.</p>

<h2>Task 1: Adder/Subtractor</h2>


<p>Build a circuit that can do both addition and subtraction. Specifically, surround your adder with additional gates so
  that it performs both addition and subtraction. This circuit should contain <em>one</em> adder only. Be sure to ask
  for clarification if you don't understand this requirement. </p>


<p>Your inputs <em>must</em> be named <code>InputA</code>, <code>InputB</code>, and <code>Op</code>. If not, your
  circuit won't work with my tests. The <code>Op</code> input specifies whether to perform addition or subtraction.
  (<code>1</code> means subtract, <code>0</code> means add).</p>

<p>Your outputs <em>must</em> be named <code>Output</code>, <code>CarryOut</code>, and <code>Overflow</code>.
  <code>CarryOut</code>
  is the carry out from the last full adder. It is also, in effect, the overflow indicator for <em>unsigned</em>
  addition. Unsigned subtraction cannot overflow. (Subtraction that generates a negative result is not considered
  "overflow".) <code>Overflow</code> is the overflow indicator for <em>singed</em> operations. Remember,
  <code>CarryOut</code> and <code>Overflow</code> will not necessarily have the same value.</p>

<p>You may use this test file (<code><a href='SampleSigned16BitAddSubtractTest.java'><code>SampleSigned16BitAddSubtractTest.java</code></a></code>) as a
  basis for your own tests. <b>Warning!</b> This test class is incomplete. Don't assume that a circuit that
  passes this sample test will pass all of my tests.

<h2>Task 2: Set if Less Than</h2>

<p>Build a circuit that can compare two integers (either signed or unsigned).</p>

<p class="listHeader">Use your adder/subtractor as a starting point and leverage the fact that</p>

<ul>
  <li>if <code>A &lt; B</code>, then <code>A - B &lt; 0</code>, and</li>
  <li>if <code>A &ge; B</code>, then <code>A - B &ge; 0</code>.
</ul>

<p>Be aware, however, that this algorithm works only as long as <code>A - B</code> doesn't overflow. You'll need to
  think about the conditions under which <code>A - B</code> might overflow, and use alternate techniques for comparing
  <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> in this case.</p>


<p>Your inputs <em>must</em> be named <code>InputA</code>, <code>InputB</code>, and <code>Signed</code>. If not, your
  circuit won't work with my tests. The <code>Signed</code> input specifies whether to perform a signed or unsigned
  comparison
  (<code>1</code> means signed, <code>0</code> means unsigned).</p>

<p>Your output <em>must</em> be named <code>LessThan</code></p>

<!---

<p>You may combine this comparison circuit with your adder/subtractor. In other words, you may implement a single
   circuit with inputs <code>InputA</code>, <code>InputB</code>, <code>Op</code>, and <code>Signed</code> and outputs
   <code>Output</code>, <code>CarryOut</code>, <code>Overflow</code>, and <code>LessThan</code>.   If you choose this
   option, your circuit should have only one adder/subtractor.

<p>You may use this file (<code><a href='SampleSlt16BitTest.java'><code>SampleSlt16BitTest.java</code></a></code>) as a
  basis for your own tests. <b>Warning!</b> This test script is incomplete. Don't assume that a circuit that
  passes this sample test will pass all of my tests.


<h2>Rules</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work in groups of <b>two</b>. You may work alone only <em>with permission of the
    instructor</em>.
  </li>

  <li>The simulator comes with a built-in adder. You may <em>not</em> use
    the built-in adder.
  </li>

  <li>To build the required circuits, you will probably find it useful to
    design and build several subcircuits. These subcircuits may have any
    interface you choose; however, you are responsible for testing them.
  </li>

  <li>You must write all of your own chips. In other words, you may not
    share "internal" chips with your classmates, or download them off the
    Internet.
  </li>

  <li>Be sure to test your components thoroughly. Just because it passes
    the test included here doesn't mean it will pass <em>my</em> test.
  </li>

  <li>You may use the built-in mux component.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Hints and shortcuts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Remember, JLS inserts the code for sub-circuits directly into the
    circuits into which they are imported. Thus, changes to sub-circuits
    are not seen by the circuits that contain them. If you discover a bug
    in a sub-circuit, you must delete and re-import that sub-circuit into
    the parent. (Again, test your subcircuits thoroughly before importing
    them!)
  </li>

  <li>Remember that no software is perfect. This includes <code>JLS</code>
    and <code>JLSCircuitTester</code>. It is in your best interest to start
    early in case problems arise. Also, please e-mail me with any bugs you
    find or feature requests you have. If JLS crashes, please e-mail me the
    <code>JLSerror</code> file.
  </li>

  <li>Remember to test your slt circuit thoroughly. My sample test file will not catch several common mistakes.</li>
</ul>
