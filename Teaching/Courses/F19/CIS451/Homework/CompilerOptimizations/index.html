</ul>

<h3>Data Hazards and Compiler Optimization</h3>

<p>Recall the discussion in last week's lab about the various types of
   hazards encountered in pipelined execution (structural hazards, data
   dependencies, control transfers). Let's review the effects of some
   of these hazards on pipelined code. Suppose I wish to execute the
   following code snippet:</p>

<blockquote><code>sum = item1 + item2;</code> <br>
   <code>total = sum + tax;</code><br>
   <span style="font-family: monospace;">sum2 </span><code>= item3 +
      item4;</code></blockquote>

<p>Assume that all data objects are 32-bit integers stored in memory at
   succeeding offsets from the address stored in <code>r1</code>. For
   example, <code>sum</code> (the first data variable) is located at an offset
   of <code>0</code> from <code>r1</code>, <code>item1</code> is located at an offset
   of 4 from <code>r1</code>, <code>item2</code> is located at an offset
   of 8 from <code>r1</code>, etc. If we wanted to load <code>item1</code>
   into register <code>r3</code>, the corresponding instruction would be:
   <b><code>lw&nbsp;r3,4(r1)</code></b>. If we wanted to load <code>item2</code>
   into register <code>r4</code>, the corresponding instruction would be:
   <b><code>lw&nbsp;r4,&nbsp;8(r1)</code></b>.</p>


<p>Perform the following: </p>
<ol>
   <li><p>Write the <span style="font-style:
italic;">straightforward</span> MIPS assembly language code that
      implements the code snippet. This means that you should write all the
      assembly for line&nbsp;1 (including any necessary <code>sw</code>
      instructions) before writing the assembly for line&nbsp;2. Your code should
      not explicitly list any stalls. There should be 11 machine
      instructions in your code, not including the <code>noops</code>
      and <code>trap #0</code> used to flush the pipeline at the end of the
      program.</p>

      <p class="listHeader"> Note: For this, and the next 4 problems, you may find it helpful to
         "run" your code through the <b>dlxview</b> simulator. (Remember that
         you can choose Next Cycle to step through the code one cycle at a time
         if desired.) Using <code>dlxview</code> is not required, but should you choose to,
         make note of the following differences between DLX assembly and MIPS
         assembly:</p>
      <UL>

         <li> When writing code for <code>dlxview</code>, don't put dollar signs in front
            of the registers.

         <li> Registers are
            named <code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code>, <code>r3</code>, etc.
            Notice the lower case "r".
         <li> Comments begin with semi-colons (;), not hashes (#).
         <li> You must use spaces, not tabs.
         <li> Store word is written like this: <code>sw 6(R1), R6</code>.
      </ul>
      <p></p>

   <li> How many cycles does it take the "dlxview" machine to "execute"
      the code that you have written (not including the <code>trap #0</code>
      at the end)? (Start counting with cycle 0, and stop counting when the final <code>sw</code> instruction is in the
      "WB" state. Note that the total number of cycles is one more than the number DLXview gives to the last cycle.)
   </li>

   <li> Show the locations of the stalls and branch delays in your code
      from problem&nbsp;1.

   <li> Pretend you are an optimizing compiler: Rearrange (not
      rewrite) the instruction sequence to eliminate the data hazards (and
      the subsequent stalls).
   </li>

   <li> How many cycles does your "optimized" code take to execute?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Control Hazards and Compiler Optimization</h3>
As described last week, the compiler (or an assembly language
programmer) needs to insert a <b><code>nop</code></b> immediately following
a conditional branch instruction. This <i>branch delay slot</i> is
necessary to deal with the control hazard introduced by the
branch. However, an optimizing compiler can mask the latency
introduced by the branch by identifying useful work that is independent
of the branch instruction. This work is then inserted into the
pipeline in place of the <b><code>nop</code></b>.
<P>
   Consider a typical loop that adds two matrices:

<P>
<blockquote><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; MAX; i++) {</code> <br>
   <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; c[i] = a[i] + b[i];</code><br>
   <code>}</code><br>
   <code>c[MAX] = 0;</code>
</blockquote>
<p>The program <a href="exampleCO-1.s"><code>exampleCO-1.s</code></a> gives the DLX
   assembly code for the loop (with MAX set to 4). </p>
<ol start=6>

   <li> Run <code>exampleCO-1</code> through <code>dlxview</code> then Identify <em>and explain</em>
      all data and control hazards that result in "wasted" cycles. Look carefully, there is a data hazard you
      probably don't expect!
   </li>

   <li> How many cycles does it take to complete the program in
      <code>exampleCO-1.s</code> when <code>MAX</code> is 4?
   </li>

   <li> Now, state the number of cycles as a function of <code>MAX</code>.

   <li> Re-arrange the code to eliminate any data hazards and branch
      delay slots.

   <li> How many cycles does it take to complete your optimized program
      when <code>MAX = 4</code>?

   <li> State the number of cycles of your re-arranged program as a function in terms of <code>MAX</code>. (<b>Important:</b>
      At this point, have the instructor double-check your answers to make sure you're on the right track.)

</ol>

<p>The "speedup" of the optimized code is the factor by which we would
   multiply the running time of the optimized code to get the running
   time of the original code. For example, if MAX is 1, the original
   code takes 18 cycles to run, whereas the optimized code takes only 15
   cycles. This gives a speedup of 1.2, because 15*1.2 = 18.</p>

<p>Notice that the speedup depends on <code>MAX</code>.</p>

<ol start=12>
   <li> What is the speedup of your optimized code when <code>MAX = 4</code>?

   <li><p>Use your favorite plotting tool (I like <code>gnuplot</code>) to
      plot the speedup of your optimized code as a function of
      <code>MAX</code>. Attach the graph to your lab submission.</p>

      <p class="listHeader"> To run <code>gnuplot</code>, type <code>"gnuplot"</code> in a
         Linux shell. The following commands will plot a graph and save it
         as a <code>.jpeg</code> file:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><code>set term jpeg</code></li>

         <li><code>set output "myPlot.jpeg"</code></li>

         <li><code>plot [1:100] (x + 1)/(3*x+10)</code>. (The parameter
            <code>[1:100]</code> tells gnuplot to plot values for
            <code>1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;100</code> only.)

      </ul>

   </li>


   <li> As <code>MAX</code> gets large, the speedup approaches an upper
      bound. What is this bound?

</ol>


<h3>Optimizing by re-writing code</h3>

<p>Notice that the main body of the loop has three <code>addi</code> and
   one <code>subi</code> instruction. We could really improve the speed
   of this loop if we could somehow load and store values from the
   arrays <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> by
   incrementing the offsets instead of incrementing the base pointers
   (because all three arrays use the same offset). Unfortunately, this
   is not possible because, in MIPS, the offset in an immediate value and
   is fixed at compile time.</p>

<p>A smart compiler, however, can greatly reduce running time by
   "unrolling" the loop. In other words, a smart compiler can replicate
   the body of a loop and eliminate extra branch instructions and extra
   index value increments. When replicating the body of the loop, you
   will need to </p>

<ul>
   <li> eliminate redundant computations,</li>
   <li> adjust the loop decrement and termination code,</li>
   <li> eliminate unnecessary branches, and</li>
   <li> adjust the addresses of loads and stores to compensate for the
      new "size" of an iteration.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>You may also need to use additional registers.</p>

<OL start=15>

   <li> Assume that the value of <code>MAX</code> is known to be 4 at
      the time the program is compiled. "Unroll" the optimized loop
      from problem 9 and optimize the unrolled loop to use as few
      cycles as possible. Where possible, modify the offset
      of <code>lw</code> instructions in order to
      remove <code>addi</code> instructions.  (Because MAX is known at
      compile time, you are effectively removing the loop. Your
      optimized code should have 17 instructions and no stalls.)
   </li>

   <li> How many cycles does your "unrolled" assembly take?</li>

   <li> What is the speedup of this unrolled code over the optimized
      program from problem 9?
   </li>

   <li> The tradeoff of unrolling loops is that your source code grows in length. By what percentage did your source
      code grow when you unrolled the loop (as compared to the source code you wrote for problem 9)? Do not count the
      trailing <code>nops</code> and <code>trap #0</code>.
   </li>

</ol>

<P>

   Unrolling loops is trickier when the number of iterations is not known
   at compile time; but, it is still possible. The trick is to
   re-organize the loop so that each iteration of the "unrolled" loop
   handles <code>I</code> iterations of the original loop. (For example, when <code>I = 4</code>,
   the first iteration of the unrolled loop contains instructions to
   complete iterations 1 through 4 of the original loop; the second iteration of the unrolled loop contains instructions
   to complete iterations 5 through 8 of the original loop, etc.) This way, the
   program suffers the "loop overhead" only once every <code>I</code>
   loops.

<OL start=19>


   <li> Assume that the value of <code>MAX</code> is not known at
      compile time, but is known at run-time before the loop begins. Unroll
      the optimized loop from problem 9 so that each iteration of the
      unrolled loop performs the work of 4 original loops. (In other words,
      iteration 1 of the new loop computes c[0] through c[3]; iteration 2
      computes c[4] through c[7], etc.) For simplicity, assume that
      <code>MAX</code> is a multiple of 4.

   <li> How could you modify your code so that it could handle any value
      of <code>MAX</code> (as opposed to multiples of 4 only)?
   </li>

   <li> Write a function that describes the number of cycles taken by
      your optimized code (from problem 19) in terms of <code>MAX</code>. <em>(Verify your answer
      with the instructor before continuing.)</em>
   </li>


   <li> When <code>MAX</code> is large, what is the speedup of the unrolled version as compared to the optimized code
      from problem 9?
   </li>


   <li> How much bigger (in terms of percentage) is the unrolled source code than the version in problem 9?

</ol>

<p> Thus far, we have been unrolling code in groups of 4; however, you
   can unroll code using arbitrarily large groups. For the remaining
   problems consider what would happen if you unrolled your code in
   groups of <code>I</code> iterations.</p>

<ol start="24">

   <li> Write a function that describes the number of cycles taken by
      your unrolled loop in terms of both <code>MAX</code>, and
      <code>I</code> (the number of iterations per unrolled loop.) Your
      formula will consider three types of instructions: (1) Instructions
      that appear once per original iteration (e.g., the <code>lw</code>
      instructions), (2) instructions that appear once per unrolled
      iteration (e.g., the branch instruction), and (3) instructions that
      appear once per program (e.g., the final <code>sw</code>). You can test
      your formula by making sure that it reduces to your answer for
      Problem&nbsp;21 when <code>I = 4</code>.
   </li>

   <li>Write a function that describes the speedup of your unrolled loop
      (as compared to the optimized code in problem 9) in terms of both
      <code>MAX</code>, and <code>I</code>.
   </li>

   <li> As <code>MAX</code> grows large, the effects of the constant
      terms (i.e., the "<code>+6</code>") become negligible. If you ignore
      these terms, <code>MAX</code> should cancel, leaving a formula in
      terms of <code>I</code>. What is it?
   </li>

   <li> What is the limit of this speedup as <code>I</code> grows?
      (Hint: There is a finite limit. If you think that the answer is
      "there is no limit", then you made a mistake somewhere.)
   </li>

   <li> Calculate the size of your unrolled loop as a function of <code>I</code>.</li>

   <li> What is the limit of this function as <code>I</code> grows?</li>

   <li> What would you consider the optimal number of iterations per
      unrolled loop? Why? (This is an opinion question. There isn't a
      right answer, you just have to say something thoughtful.)
   </li>

</ol>

<h3>Adding floating point to the mix</h3>

The longer latencies of floating-point arithmetic make compiler
optimizations more interesting, and more important.  Consider a
typical loop that adds a scalar value to a vector of double-precision
floating point values in memory.&nbsp; The loop might look something
like this: </p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (i=0;&nbsp; i&lt;4; i++)</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A[i] = A[i] + x;</code> </p>
<p>The program <a href="example8-3.s">example8-3.s</a> gives the DLX
assembly code for the loop. </p>
<p>When this loop is executed on the DLX pipeline it incurs certain
latencies.&nbsp; If we consider the stalls and idle clock cycles, it
executes as follows: </p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
addi r1, r0, #32</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop:&nbsp;&nbsp; ld f0, 0(r1)</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
stall</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
addd f4, f0, f2</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
stall</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
stall</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sd 0(r1), f4</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
subi r1, r1, 8</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bnez r1, Loop</code> <br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
delay</code> </p>
<p>There are several different types of delays introduced here: </p>
<ul>
  <li> As with integer operations, there is a one-cycle <i>load
interlock</i> stall necessary to read in the double from memory before
using it in the <code>addd</code> operation.</li>

  <li> Because floating-point operations take longer than integer
  operations, there must be <em>two</em> cycles between
  the <code>addd</code> instruction and the instruction that stores
  the result of that <code>addd</code>.

  <li> Also, as before, there is also a <i>branch delay slot</i> after
the conditional.</li>


 Perform the following:
<ol start="29">
  <li> Reschedule (rearrange) the instructions of this loop to reduce
the clock cycles per iteration (but, don't unroll it yet.)  The
optimal solution will have only one stall, and no branch delay.
(Hint: You are allowed to modify the <code>sd</code> instruction
slightly.)

  <li> Unroll your code from problem 28 by simply replicating the loop
  body four times.  For this problem, don't re-arrange the code, just
  remove the branch statement and make the necessary adjustments to
  the indices.  Also, please indicate the presence of stalls in your code.

  <li> Now, re-arrange your unrolled code to eliminate all stalls.
  You may have to rename some registers to do this.
  
  <li> As with problems 23 and 25, compute the speed-up and increase
  in source code as a function of the number iterations per unrolled loop.
