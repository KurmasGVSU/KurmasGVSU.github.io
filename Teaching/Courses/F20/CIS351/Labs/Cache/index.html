<h3> Overview</h3>

This lab uses the <a target="_top"
                     href="http://www.simplescalar.com">Simplescalar</a> CPU simulator to investigate the
effects of different cache configurations on performance.

<!-- >
<p>Lab 11 is problems 1-5.</br>
    Lab 12 is problems 6-11.</p>
    -->

<p>This lab will be due in two pieces.  Part 1 is problems 1-5; it will be due next week. Part 2 is problems 6 - 11; it will be due the Monday after Thanksgiving.
    Officially, there is not lab Thanksgiving week; but, I will be online to answer questions with Part 2.  Anyone is welcome to addend (regardless of your 
    scheduled lab time).
</p>

<h3>Simplescalar</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.simplescalar.com">Simplescalar</a> is a suite of
    programs that simulate the execution of programs compiled using a
    MIPS-like instruction set called PISA. You can simulate the execution
    of any program using Simplescalar by simply re-compiling it
    using a version of <code>gcc</code> that knows how to generate PISA
    instructions as well as x86 instructions.</p>

<p>For this lab, you will be using the tool <code>sim-cache</code>. This
    tool takes as input a description of a machine's memory hierarchy
    (i.e., cache levels) and reports on the number of hits and misses in
    each cache. Section 4.2 of <a href="TR_1342.pdf">The Simplescalar
        Tech Report</a> explains how to describe the cache setup you want to
    simulate. When you read through this section, take note of three things:</p>
<ul class='listHeader'>
    <li> With <code>sim-cache</code>, you don't specify the size of the
        cache directly. Instead you specify (1) the number of lines, (2)
        the block size, and (3) the associativity of the cache. The size
        of the cache is the product of these three numbers. Thus, a 4-way set
        associative cache with 1024 lines of 16 bytes each is 4*1024*16 =
        65536 bytes (64 kilobytes).

    <li> The cache to be configured is mentioned twice on the command
        line. (The phrase "<code>dl1</code>" will appear twice when
        configuring the L1 data cache.)

    <li> The parameters to <code>sim-cache</code> frequently uses both
        "<code>1</code>" (the numeral "one") and "<code>l</code>" (a
        lower-case letter "L"). Watch carefully because the differences
        in print between the two can be subtle.
</ul>

<p>
    For example, to configure a machine with an 8KB, direct-mapped L1 data
    cache with 32 byte blocks, use this command: <code> -cache:dl1
    dl1:256:32:1:l</code>. Notice that 256 blocks times 32 bytes per
    block equals 8192 bytes.</p>

<p>When running <code>sim-cache</code>, I recommend sending the output
    directly to a file using the command line
    parameters <code>-redir:sim <em>file1</em></code>
    and <code>-redir:prog <em>file2</em></code>. <code>file1</code>
    will contain the results of the simulation (i.e., cache hit and miss
    rates). <code>file2</code> will contain the output produced by
    the program simulated. This data is generally not interesting.</p>

<h3>Using a VM for Simplescalar</h3>

<p class='listHeader'>Simplescalar is designed to run on 32-bit machines.  So, instead of using Arch/EOS directly, 
we will be using a Virtual Machine.   Our sysadmin Tom has set up five virtual machines for us to use. 
They have these IP addresses:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>192.168.216.22</code></li>
<li><code>192.168.216.26</code></li>
<li><code>192.168.216.27</code></li>
<li><code>192.168.216.28</code></li>
<li><code>192.168.216.29</code></li>
</ul>

<p>To access these machines, you must first log into an EOS or Arch machine.  Then, use <code>ssh</code> to log into 
one of the VMs: <span class='inline-instruction'>ssh simple@192.168.216.<em>X</em></span> 
(where <code><em>X</em></code> is the number of the particular machine you chose.  Just pick one at random.) 
The username is <code>simple</code> and the password is <code>SimpleSim2020</code>.</p>

<p>You will all be sharing these machines; so,</p>
<ol class='listHeader'>
  <li>the first time please create a directory to use as your workspace 
(so you don't accidentally mess up others' work).
<li>Be nice.</li>
</ol>
 
 <p>Note: The VMs do not have a GUI.</p>


<h3>Effects of block size</h3>

<p>Your first task is to examine the effects of block size on a "toy"
    program. Look
    at <a href="blockSize1.c"><code>blockSize1.c</code></a>. This small
    program iterates through each byte in a large array. First, you will need to copy 
    this file to your space on a VM:
   <span class='inline-instruction'>scp blockSize1.c simple@192.168.216.X:<em>yourDirectory</em></span>
    
    Next, compile this C program for Simplescalar using the following
    command:<span class='inline-instruction'> ss_gcc blockSize1.c</span>  (Make sure you are in <em>your</em> directory so you don't end up 
    overwriting someone else's file.) Running this command will produce a file named <code>a.out</code>.
    (As with the normal version of <code>gcc</code>, you can specify the
    name of the executable generated using the <code>-o</code> flag.)
    This file will not run by itself. It will run only as input to one of
    the Simplescalar programs. If it does, you generated it using the wrong version of <code>gcc</code>.
</p>

<ol>
    <li> Use <code>sim-cache</code> to determine the miss-rates of an 8KB, direct-mapped cache with the
        following block sizes: 8 bytes, 16 bytes, 32 bytes, and 64 bytes. To
        do so, use commands that look like this:</p>

        <p><span class='inline-instruction'>sim-cache -cache:dl1
            dl1:<em>line</em>:<em>block</em>:1:l -redir:prog /dev/null -redir:sim
            output_<em>block</em> a.out</span></p>

        <p>Where <em>block</em> ranges from 8 to 64, and <em>line</em> is set
            such that product of <em>block</em> times <em>line</em> is
            8192.</p>

        Hints for running sim-cache:
        <ul class='listHeader'>
            <li> Notice that the end of the cache configuration parameter is
                the number <code>1</code> followed by the letter <code>l</code> (as in
                "lru").
            </li>

            <li><code>sim-cache</code> is in <code>/Simplescalar/simplesim-3.0/sim-cache</code></li>

            <li> It's not difficult to make a script to automatically runs <code>sim-cache</code> with
                varying block sizes and present the results. This line provides an example of how to perform
                arithmetic in                a bash script:
                <span class='inline-instruction'>let num_lines=8192/$i</span></li>
        </ul>


        <p> After you have run <code>sim-cache</code> for each block size,
            <code>grep</code> each output file (<code>output_8</code>, <code>output_16</code>,
            etc.) for the line "<code>dl1.miss_rate</code>". List the miss rate
            for each block size tested.</p></li>

    <li> Based on your observations, determine a formula for the miss
        rate in terms of <em>block_size</em>.
    </li>

    <li>Explain your results (i.e., what is happening in the cache
        during each memory access to produce the results you observed).
    </li>

    <li> Now, write a C program for which the miss rate is considerably higher for a 16 byte block than for an 8 byte
        block. (The easiest way to do this is to find two array locations that conflict with a 16-byte block, but not
        with an 8-byte block. If you do this, you will see the cache with the 8-byte blocks have a nearly 0% miss rate
        while the cache with the 16-byte blocks has nearly a 100% miss rate.) List your source code, all cache
        parameters used, and the resulting hit rates. Hint: You need not loop through the entire array. Instead, find
        two addresses that collide in the cache. Remove the inner loop and make <code>NUM_LOOPS</code> 1000000.
    </li>
</ol>

Hints for writing programs with a specified cache behavior:
<ul>

    <li> Notice in <code>blockSize1.c</code> that <code>array</code> is
        an array of characters; therefore, each item in the cache is exactly
        1 byte. As a result, it is easy to identify data items that will or
        will not conflict in the cache. For example, in an 8KB direct-mapped
        cache, array bytes 0 and 8192 will conflict. Your job is to find
        sets of array elements that conflict with a 16 byte block, but not an
        8 byte block.
    </li>

    <li><code>gcc</code> is a <em>C</em> compiler. Your code must be
        straight C. No iostreams; no "//"-style comments; and, all variables
        must be declared at the beginning of each function.
    </li>

    <li> Declaring the local variables as "register" variables encourages
        the compiler to keep the values of these variables in a register,
        thereby reducing their effect on the cache hit rate.
    </li>

    <li><span class='important'>Ideally, the array in the C code will line up with
        the beginning of the cache. In other words, <code>array[0]</code>
        should be mapped to cache slot 0. Sometimes, it gets mapped to <code>array[8]</code>.
        If you are confident your solution should work; but, it doesn't try adding 8 to each array index.</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3> Optimal block size</h3>

Your next task is to determine the optimal block size for
<code>qsort</code>.

<ol start=5>
    <li> Determine the optimal block size for <code>qsort</code> given a
        1KB, 4KB, and 16KB cache. Present your results using a graph with
        block size on the x-axis and the miss rate on the y-axis. Please
        generate one graph with three lines: One each for 1KB, 4KB, and 16KB.
        Valid block sizes are 8, 16, 32, and 64. Your graph should have a form similar to
        <a href="effectsOfBlockSize.jpg">Figure 8.18</a> in Harris and Harris (2nd edition).
    </li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li> Use <code>input_1e4</code> for input. (It contains 50,000
        randomly generated integers.)
    </li>
    <li> The <code>ss_qsort</code> executable and sample inputs are found in
        <code>~/TestData</code>.
        <!-- The executable
        for <code>sim-cache</code> is in
        <code>~kurmasz/public/Simplescalar/bin</code>--> </li>
    <li> To simulate a 1KB,
        direct-mapped cache with 16 byte blocks, use the following (very long)
        command line:
        <br><code>sim-cache -cache:dl1
            dl1:64:16:1:l -redir:prog opt -redir:sim output_dl1:64:16:1:l
            ~/TestData/ss_qsort ~/TestData/input_1e4</code>

        <!--- skip for now.  Need sample problems that exhibit more interesting cache behavior

        <LI> Recall that different cache configurations have different
      overheads.  Compute which block line has the highest "hit-rate to total
      size" ratio.

        -->
    </li>
    <li>This program should take a few seconds to run. If it finishes instantly,
        then something isn't configured correctly. The file <code>opt</code> may give you a clue. If not,
        ask the instructor for help.
    </li>
    <li>If you are using <code>gnuplot</code>, entering the line <code>set style data linespoints</code> will plot all
        data files using the "linespoints" style. Using this shortcut means that you won't have to type
        <code>with linespoints</code> after every file.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="Part2"><h3>Effects of associativity</h3></a>

<ol start=6>
    <li> Write a simple C program for which a 4-way associative cache has
        a significantly lower miss rate than a equally sized 2-way set
        associative cache. You may choose any cache size and block size you
        wish, but they must remain the same for the entire problem. Submit       
        the source code, all cache parameters, and resulting hit rates. Hint: Write the simplest program you can that
        will produce a 100% miss rate for the 2-way cache.
    </li>

    <li> Write a simple C program for which an associativity of 2 has a
        <em>higher</em> miss rate than a direct-mapped cache. You may choose
        any cache size and block size you wish, but they must remain the same
        for the entire problem. Submit the source code, all cache parameters,
        and resulting hit rates. As with the previous problem, start by writing a program that has a 100% miss rate
        for a 2-way cache.
    </li>

    <li>Explain why your code above produces the miss rates observed
        (i.e., why your code has a higer miss rate on the two-way
        cache).
    </li>

    <li> Choose <code>qsort</code> (or another interesting program of
        your choice) and a cache size. Produce a graph showing miss
        rates as associativity ranges over 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and fully
        associative. Your graph should have associativity on the x-axis,
        and miss-rate on the y-axis. It should also contain four lines:
        one for each block size. Be sure to clearly label your graph
        with the cache size. Your graph should have a form similar to
        <a href="effectsOfAssoc.jpg">Figure 5.30</a> in Patterson and Hennessey (4th edition, revised).
    </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3> Effects of replacement policy</h3>

<ol start=10>

    <li> Write a simple C program for which a random replacement policy
        results in a significantly lower miss rate than LRU. (Use an 8-way
        set associative cache with a size and block size of your choosing.)
        Submit the source code, all cache parameters, and resulting hit rates.
    </li>

    <li>Choose a cache size and block size. Plot the effects of associativity and replacement policy on qsort. Your
        graph should have associativity on the x-axis and miss rate on the y-axis. There should be three lines: one for
        each replacement policy.
    </li>

</ol>
