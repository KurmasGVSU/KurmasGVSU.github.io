<p>
  For this project, you will use JLS to implement a <em>signed</em> adder.</p>



<p>You should work in teams of two. This project is a lot of work.  Working alone is foolish.</p>

<p>Begin by following <a href='https://classroom.github.com/a/vDMFABVZ'>this GitHub Classroom link</a> 
to create the repository for this project.  You may want to copy your unsigned adder from the lab 
into this new repo.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>Implement a 16-bit <em>signed</em> adder using any algorithm you
  wish, provided the circuit (1) has a reasonable size, (2) a running time of 225 or better, and 
  (3) at least partially incorporates elements of a sub-linear algorithm 
  (carry-lookahead, carry-select, Kogge-Stone, etc.)
   Your adder must report overflow conditions when they
  occur (with respect to signed inputs).
  Notice that this circuit must have an input named <code>CarryIn</code>.
  You will use this input for future projects.</p>


<p>The starter code contains a file named <code>SignedAdder_16bit.jls</code>.  You must place your solution 
in this file.  Do <em>not</em> change the names of any of the inputs or outputs.  (If you change the filename
or the names of any inputs/outputs, the automated tests will not work.)

<p><code>CarryOut</code> is the carry out from the last full adder. It is also,
  in effect, the overflow indicator for <em>unsigned</em> inputs. <code>Overflow</code> is the overflow
  indicator for <em>signed</em> inputs. Remember, <code>CarryOut</code> and <code>Overflow</code> will not
  necessarily have the same value.</p>

<p>You may use <a href='SampleSigned16BitAdderTest.java'><code>SampleSigned16BitAdderTest.java</code></a> as a basis for your own tests. <b>Warning!</b> This
  test file is incomplete. Don't assume that a circuit that passes this sample test will pass all of my tests.

<h2 class="listHeader">Rules</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work in groups of <b>two</b>. You may work alone only <em>with permission of the
    instructor</em>.
  </li>
  <li>The simulator comes with a built-in adder. You may <em>not</em> use
    the built-in adder.
  </li>
  <li>To build the required circuits, you will probably find it useful to
    design and build several subcircuits. These subcircuits may have any
    interface you choose; however, you are responsible for testing them.
  </li>
  <li>You must write all of your own circuits/subcircuits. In other words, you may not
    share "internal" subcircuits with your classmates, or download them off the
    Internet.
  </li>
  <li>Be sure to test your components thoroughly. Just because your adder passes
    the test included here doesn't mean it will pass <em>my</em> tests.
  </li>
</ol>


<h2 class="listHeader">Hints and shortcuts</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Remember, you can create and import subcircuits (analogous to writing a
  function in code).  Go to "File -&gt; Import" to import a saved subcircuit.</li>

  <li>JLS inserts the code for sub-circuits directly into the
    circuits into which they are imported. Thus, changes to sub-circuits
    are not seen by the circuits that contain them. If you discover a bug
    in a sub-circuit, you must delete and re-import every instance of that sub-circuit into
    the parent. (Again, test your subcircuits thoroughly before importing
    them!)
  </li>

  <li>Remember that no software is perfect. This includes <code>JLS</code>
    and <code>DLUnit</code>. Commit and push your code often.  That way, if JLS does crash
    you won't lose too much work. Also, please e-mail me with any bugs you
    find or feature requests you have. If JLS crashes, please e-mail me the
    <code>JLSerror</code> file.
  </li>

  <li>You may use the built-in mux.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id='analysis'>Analysis</h2>

<p class='listHeader'>When your adder passes all of the automated tests, prepare a document that discusses its overall design 
and analyzes its</p>
  <ul>
    <li>exact size</li>
    <li>exact running time</li>
    <li>big-O running time</li>
  </ul>

<p>To compute the exact size, simply count the total number of gates used.  (You don't need to consider the number of inputs.)</p>

<p>To compute the exact time, compute the propagation delay using the default component delays given by JLS (10 for AND, OR, XOR, 5 for NOT, NAND, NOR, etc.).  
To see a component's default delay, right-click on it and choose "change timing" from the context menu.  (Look at the time; but, don't actually chagne it!)</p>

<p>Your adder's big-O running time describes how the running time will change if you applied your pattern to adders of increasing size.
If you used a hybrid design, describe how you would extend your design to build 32-bit and  64-bit adders.  
(Your technique for extending your hybrid design will determine the big-O running time.)</p>

<p>Finally, add a paragraph or two discussing your adder's overall design.  In particular, if you used a hybrid design, list any sub-linear addition algorithms used and how you
incorporated them into your adder.</p>

<p>Place this information in a file named either <code>analysis.txt</code> or <code>analysis.pdf</code>.   For each answer, please include 
a paragraph or two describing how you got your answer.</p>


<h2><a id="Grading">Grading</a></h2>

<p> <span class='inline-important'>You are expected to revise your circuits and analysis documents until 
<em>both</em> (1) the automated tests pass, <em>and</em> (2) the analysis document has earned a score of "E" or "M".</span> 
Project "Late Days" will accumulate until both requirements have been satisfied.  

<p class='listHeader'><b>Extra Credit</b>: You can earn extra credit on this project based on the time of your adder:</p>
<ul>
<li> &le; 150:  1 point</li>
<li> &le; 100:  2 point</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also accumulate up to -2 Late Days if you project meets all requirements before the deadline. 
 (Negative Late Days can be used to offset any Late Days acquired on other projects or labs.)



<h2>Submission</h2>

<p class="listHeader">To submit your project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add a text box to your <code>jls</code> files that includes the names of all team members.
    </ul>

   <li>
   Place your analysis in a file named <code>analysis.txt</code> or <code>analysis.pdf</code>.
  </li>

  <li>Push your project with <code>[Grade Me]</code> in the commit message.  (<code>[Grade Me]</code> is not a 
  formal syntax, it is just tells me that you are ready for me to look at your project.)
   </li>
</ol>
