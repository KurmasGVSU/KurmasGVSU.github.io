text=# You have a program that takes as input a directed, weighted graph and returns the shortest / least-cost path.  You can easily use this program to find the shortest route between your house and work.  Unfortunately, the shortest route is not the quickest.  Simply setting the weights equal to time between intersections doesn't quite work either, because it doesn't account for stop signs and traffic lights.  Design a graph that can be fed to your shortest-path algorithm to find the quickest route to work.%0a#You have a big bag of letters A through Z.  Each letter is used multiple times.  Problem:  Figure out whether you can arrange the letters in a string that contains no doubble letters.%0a** Now figure out if you can arrage the letters in a string that contains exactly n double letters, but no tripple letters.%0a# You have a program that lets you input a route for a trip (e.g, Grand Rapids to Atlanta), and computes where the optimal places to stop for gas, given the variations in gas prices around the country and your tank size.  This program assums you begin your trip with a full tank of gas.  %0a** Suppose you have a half-tank of gas and you want to know whether you should fill up at home, or down the road.  How can you use your program without modification to do this?%0a** Does your solution provide an exact answer, or only an estimate?  Explain why your answer is exact, or provide a counter example.%0a# Show how to implement the unix command cat using diff and head%0a# Show how to search for two different strings using "grep "foo1" | grep "foo2""%0a# Show how to get teh middle x lines using head and tail%0a# Put up a sudoku board numbered 1-9 on rows and columns, then number sections (1,1) through (3,3) and have stuents find formulas for squares in section%0a# You have two strings in a file "JumpDistanceWithinState_OperationType_LocationDelta_Dep_JDWS" and "JumpDistanceWithinState_bl_OperationType_LocationDelta_Dep_JDWS" .  What is the smallest search string you can use to find the first string without finding the second?
