    <p>Kielce is a JavaScript library that provides a simple, lightweight,
        <em>client-side</em> technique for moving configurable static content
        from an HTML document into a separate file where it can more easily
        and accurately be managed. For example, Kielce simplifies the process
        of updating a syllabus each semester by collecting the content that
        changes (e.g., semester name, office hours, exam dates) into a
        separate file. Kielce can also simplify the process of sharing an
        assignment among several sections of a course by allowing instructors
        to pull any information specific to an individual section out of the
        main HTML file and into the Kielce data file. This refactoring
        reduces the need for collision detection if the main document is
        updated.</p>

    <h2>Use Case 1: Syllabi</h2>

    <p>The primary content of a syllabus changes little from semester to
        semester. However, many syllabi contain some data that changes every
        semester, such as the semester name, office hours, exam dates, and
        withdrawal dates. One common way of updating this data is to simply
        run a search-and-replace on the previous semester's syllabus. This
        technique is tedious and error-prone. For example, is easy to forget
        to replace one of the exam dates.</p>

    <p>Kielce allows authors to factor semester-dependent information out
        of the HTML file and into a separate JavaScript file. Having this
        data in the JavaScript file is helpful because all the data that must
        be updated is in one place. It is easy to find the data, and
        difficult to overlook a needed update.</p>

    <p>A typical syllabus prepared in HTML might contain several lines
        like this:</p>

    <pre>
   Withdrawal Deadline:  5 March 2012
   ...
   &lt;li&gt;Exam 1: 16 February 2012&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Exam 2: 17 March 2012&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Final Exam: 23 April 2012&lt;/li&gt;
   ...
</pre>

    <p><a name="directions">To factor these dates into a separate file using Kielce requires
        only 3 steps:</a>

    <ol>
        <li> Surround the information to be moved with a tag containing a <code>kkey</code> attribute (the content of
            the
            tag itself becomes a default value):

            <pre>
   Withdrawal Deadline:  &lt;span kkey="withdraw"&gt;5 March 2012&lt;/span&gt;
   ...
   &lt;li&gt;Exam 1: &lt;span kkey="exam1"&gt;16 February 2012&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Exam 2: &lt;span kkey="exam2"&gt;17 March 2012&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Final Exam: &lt;span kkey="exam3"&gt;23 April 2012&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   ...
   </pre>
        </li>

        <li>Create a file named <code>kielceData.js</code> containing an associative array mapping the keys above to
            their
            desired values:

            <pre>
   ({
     Override: {
       withdraw: "5 March 2012",
       exam1: "16 February 2012",
       exam2: "17 March 2012",
       finalExam: "23 April, 2012"
     }
   });
   </pre>
        </li>

        <li>Add two lines of JavaScript to the HTML file to run Kielce:
            <pre>
      &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="kielce3.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
         Kielce.run();
      &lt;/script&gt;
   </pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>At this point, "using" Kielce means simply distributing <code>kielce3.js</code> along with the main HTML file.
        There is no need for special software or web server configuration.</p>


    <h2>Use Case 2: Sharing Assignments Among Sections</h2>

    <p>At GVSU, we have up to six different sections of CS 2 taught by six different instructors. We make a strong
        effort to use the same projects across all sections. However, using exactly the same assignment document has
        been
        difficult. The sections meet on different days, so assignments usually have slightly different schedules. Also,
        some instructors like to offer different explanations or extra credit options. In the past,
        instructors have customized the prepared assignment document, only to have the author submit an update a few
        days
        later. At this point, the instructors must manually merge the changes into their customized version of the
        assignment. The changes are almost always minor; but, the manual merging is annoying.</p>

    <p>Using Kielce can reduce the need for manual merging. The author need only place tags (e.g.,
        <code>span</code> or <code>div</code>) where instructors have requested "hooks" for custom content.</p>


    <h2>Advantages of Using Kielce</h2>

    <p>Our hope is that other instructors find our assignments and other course materials useful and choose to
        adopt them at their institutions. We expect that instructors who do adopt our assignments will want to modify or
        extend them. Thus, our first goal is for Kielce to simplify the process of modifying these documents. However,
        it is also important that Kielce be as unobtrusive as possible so that instructors who do not wish to use it can
        almost completely ignore it. (In other words, we don't want our use of Kielce to hinder the adoption of our
        course
        materials elsewhere.) Kielce's use of JavaScript helps us achieve these goals.</p>

    <p>All of the processing is done on the client side in the web browser. There is no need to install any scripts or
        other
        special software, nor is it necessary to pre-process the documents before sending them to the server. Similarly,
        there is no need to specially configure the web server. (In particular, users need not configure their server
        and/or
        web space for PHP.) As long as the JavaScript files remain with the HTML files,
        the web browser will display the documents correctly.</p>

    <p>Using JavaScript also means that it is easy for authors to preview the documents they are editing. The web
        browser renders the finished product. The authors need not run a script after every edit; nor must they set up a
        full-featured web server on their local machine to view documents that they are editing off-line.</p>


    <p>The main limitation to using JavaScript for Kielce is that users do need to run a simple web server to view
        documents locally. JavaScript will not load the data files directly from the local file system; it will only
        request the data files from a web server. Fortunately, running a server is as simple as installing Python and
        running <code>python -m
            SimpleHTTPServer</code> from the command line.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Features</h2>

    Kielce's primary purpose is to substitute values from a JavaScript associative array into HTML tags containing a
    <code>kkey</code>
    attribute; however, we have added a couple minor features to add flexibility.

    <h3>Multiple data files</h3>

    <p>Kielce searches each component of a document's path for a file named <code>kielceData.js</code>. This feature
        allows
        authors to make data available to any page at a lower level of the file hierarchy. Consider the following file
        structure:</p>
    <pre>
 + Courses
   + F11
     + CS_163
     + CS_451
   + W12
     + CS_163
       + Project1
     + CS_451
</pre>

    <p>One could place office hours, the withdraw deadline, and other data pertaining to Winter Semester, 2012, in
        <code>Courses/W12/kielceData.js</code>. That data would be available to all documents in and under the
        <code>W12</code> directory.
        Similarly, everything that pertains to every CS 163 document (e.g., a link to the Academic Honesty web page),
        would go in
        <code>Courses/W12/CS_163/kielceData.js</code>. Data that applies to Project 1 only would go in
        <code>Courses/W12/CS_163/Project1/kielceData.js</code></p>

    <p>Data files are optional. Thus, there need not be a <code>kielceData.jsl</code> file at every level of the file
        hierarchy.</p>


    <p>Kielce looks for two associative arrays in each <code>kielceData.js</code> file: one named <code>Default</code>
        and one named <code>Override</code>. Kielce processes data files beginning with the root of the web space
        and works down toward the directory that contains the file to be displayed. At each level,
        values in <code>Override</code> replace any existing values; values in <code>Default</code> are applied only
        when
        there is either no value for the key in question, or the value is <code>null</code>.</p>

    <h3>Leveraging JavaScript</h3>

    <p>Because the data files are simply JavaScript, a key's value can be any valid JavaScript expression. It need not
        be a
        string literal. This allows users to automate the calculation of values. For example,
        consider a syllabus that lists three exam dates. Furthermore, assume that those exam dates are always the
        fourth,
        eight, and twelfth Friday of the semester. Kielce allows us to automate the calculation of those dates as
        follows: (The week and day are zero indexed.)</p>

    <pre>
var startOfSemester = new Date("8/21/2011");
var getSemesterDay = function (week, day) {
   var answer = new Date(startOfSemester);
   answer.setDate(startOfSemester.getDate() + (7 * week) + day);
   return answer.toDateString();
};

({
   Override: {
      exam1: getSemesterDay(3, 5),
      exam2: getSemesterDay(7, 5),
      exam3: getSemesterDay(11, 5)
   }
});
</pre>

    <p>Notice that the scope of <code>startOfSemester</code> in the example above is
        limited to the data file in which it is defined. To use <code>startOfSemester</code> throughout a web site
        requires
        (1) defining the variable in the top-level data file, and (2) making it accessible through the global namespace.
        In
        addition, data files have no access to data defined in files that have not yet been processed.</p>


    <p>Consider the
        following scenario: Every assignment in a course has two checkpoints and a final submission,
        each a week apart. Because this pattern is the same for every project, we would like to define keys for the
        checkpoints and submission in the course-level data file. However, the date on which the assignments are based
        is only defined in the project-level data file. The solution is to specify a function (the function itself,
        not a function call) as the value. Functions are evaluated after all data files have been processed. Thus,
        one would prepare the course-level data file like this:

    <pre>
var getSemesterDay = function (start, week, day) {
   var answer = new Date(start);
   answer.setDate(answer.getDate() + (7 * week) + day);
   return answer.toDateString();
};

({
   Override: {
      checkpoint1: function (data) {
         return getSemesterDay(data.startOfProject, 1, 0);
      },
      checkpoint2: function (data) {
         return getSemesterDay(data.startOfProject, 2, 0);
      },
     checkpoint3: function (data) {
         return getSemesterDay(data.startOfProject, 3, 0);
      }
   }
});
</pre>

    The values for <code>checkpoint1</code>, <code>checkpoint2</code>, and <code>checkpoint3</code> would be based on
    the
    final value of <code>startOfProject</code>. (Of course, there would be an error if the author forgot to specify
    <code>startOfProject</code> in the project's data file.)
