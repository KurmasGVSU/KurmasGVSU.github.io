    Engineering is so trendy these days that everybody wants to be one. The
    word "engineer" is greatly overused. If there's somebody in your life
    who you think is trying to pass as an engineer, give him this test to
    discern the truth.

    <P>
    <div id="headerContainer">
        <a href="#content"><H1>ENGINEER IDENTIFICATION TEST</H1></a>
    </div>
    <P>
        You walk into a room and notice that a picture is hanging crooked.
        You...

    <UL>
        <LI>A. Straighten it.
        <LI>B. Ignore it.
        <LI>C. Buy a CAD system and spend the next six months designing a
            solar-powered, self-adjusting picture frame while often stating
            aloud your belief that the inventor of the nail was a total moron.

    </UL>
    <P>
        The correct answer is "C" but partial credit can be given to anybody who
        writes "It depends" in the margin of the test or simply blames the whole
        stupid thing on "Marketing."
    <P>
    <h2>SOCIAL SKILLS</h2>

    <P>
        Engineers have different objectives when it comes to social interaction.
    <P>
        "Normal" people expect to accomplish several unrealistic things from
        social
        interaction:
    <P>
    <UL>
        <LI> Stimulating and thought-provoking conversation
        <LI>Important social contacts
        <LI>A feeling of connectedness with other humans

    </UL>
    In contrast to "normal" people, engineers have rational objectives for
    social interactions:
    <P>
    <UL>
        <LI> Get it over with as soon as possible.
        <LI>Avoid getting invited to something unpleasant.
        <LI>Demonstrate mental superiority and mastery of all subjects.

    </UL>
    <h2>FASCINATION WITH GADGETS</h2>

    <P>
        To the engineer, all matter in the universe can be placed into one of
        two
        categories:

    <OL>
        <LI> things that need to be fixed, and
        <LI> things that will need to be fixed after you've had a few minutes to
            play with them.

    </OL>
    <P>
        Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily
        available, they will create their own problems. Normal people don't
        understand this concept; they believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix
        it. Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough
        features yet.
    <P>
        No engineer looks at a television remote control without wondering what
        it would take to turn it into a stun gun. No engineer can take a shower
        without wondering if some sort of Teflon coating would make showering
        unnecessary. To the engineer, the world is a toy box full of
        sub-optimized and feature-poor toys.
    <P>

<!-- 
    <h2>FASHION AND APPEARANCE</h2>
    <P>

        Clothes are the lowest priority for an engineer, assuming the basic
        thresholds for temperature and decency have been satisfied. If no
        appendages are freezing or sticking together, and if no genitalia or
        mammary glands are swinging around in plain view, then the objective
        of clothing has been met. Anything else is a waste.
    <P>

    <h2>DATING AND SOCIAL LIFE
    </h2>
    <P>
        Dating is never easy for engineers. A normal person will employ
        various indirect and duplicitous methods to create a false impression
        of attractiveness. Engineers are incapable of placing appearance
        above function.
    <P>
        Fortunately, engineers have an ace in the hole. They are widely
        recognized as superior marriage material: intelligent, dependable,
        employed, honest, and handy around the house. While it's true that
        many normal people would prefer not to date an engineer, most normal
        people harbor an intense desire to mate with them, thus producing
        engineerlike children who will have high-paying jobs long before losing
        their virginity.
    <P>
        Male engineers reach their peak of sexual attractiveness later than
        normal men, becoming irresistible erotic dynamos in their mid thirties
        to late forties. Just look at these examples of sexually irresistible
        men in technical professions:
    <P>
    <UL>
        <LI> Bill Gates.
        <LI> MacGyver.
        <LI> Etcetera.
    </UL>
    <P>
        Female engineers become irresistible at the age of consent and remain
        that way until about thirty minutes after their clinical death. Longer
        if it's a warm day.
    <P>
-->

    <h2>HONESTY</h2>
    <P>

        Engineers are always honest in matters of technology and human
        relationships. That's why it's a good idea to keep engineers away
        from customers, romantic interests, and other people who can't
        handle the truth.
    <P>
        Engineers sometimes bend the truth to avoid work. They say things
        that sound like lies but technically are not because nobody could
        be expected to believe them. The complete list of engineer lies is
        listed below.
    <P>
    <UL>
        <LI> "I won't change anything without asking you first."
        <LI>"I'll return your hard-to-find cable tomorrow."
        <LI> "I have to have new equipment to do my job."
        <LI> "I'm not jealous of your new computer."

    </UL>
    <P>
    <h2>FRUGALITY</h2>
    <P>

        Engineers are notoriously frugal. This is not because of
        cheapness or mean spirit; it is simply because every spending
        situation is simply a problem in optimization, that is, "How can I
        escape this situation while retaining the greatest amount of
        cash?"
    <P>
    <h2>POWERS OF CONCENTRATION
    </h2>
    <P>
        If there is one trait that best defines an engineer it is the
        ability to concentrate on one subject to the complete exclusion of
        everything else in the environment. This sometimes causes
        engineers to be pronounced dead prematurely. Some funeral homes
        in high-tech areas have started checking resumes before processing
        the bodies. Anybody with a degree in electrical engineering or
        experience in computer programming is propped up in the lounge for
        a few days just to see if he or she snaps out of it.
    <P>
    <h2>RISK</h2>


    <P>
        Engineers hate risk. They try to eliminate it whenever they can.
        This is understandable, given that when an engineer makes one
        little mistake the media will treat it like it's a big deal or
        something.
    <P>
    <h2>EXAMPLES OF BAD PRESS FOR ENGINEERS</h2>


    <P>
    <UL>
        <LI> Hindenberg.
        <LI> Space Shuttle Challenger.
        <LI> SPANet(tm)
        <LI> Hubble space telescope.
        <LI> Apollo 13.
        <LI> Titanic.
        <LI> Ford Pinto.
        <LI> Corvair.
    </UL>
    <P>
        The risk/reward calculation for engineers looks something like this:
    <P>
        RISK: Public humiliation and the death of thousands of innocent people.
        REWARD: A certificate of appreciation in a handsome plastic frame.
    <P>
        Being practical people, engineers evaluate this balance of risks
        and rewards and decide that risk is not a good thing. The best
        way to avoid risk is by advising that any activity is technically
        impossible for reasons that are far too complicated to explain.
    <P>
        If that approach is not sufficient to halt the project, then the
        engineer will fall back to a second line of defense: "It's
        technically possible but it will cost too much."
    <P>
    <h2>EGO
    </h2>

    <P>
        Ego-wise, two things are important to engineers:
    <UL>
        <LI>
            How smart they are.
        <LI> How many cool devices they own.
    </UL>

    <P>
        The fastest way to get an engineer to solve a problem is to
        declare that the problem is unsolvable. No engineer can walk away
        from an unsolvable problem until it's solved. No illness or
        distraction is sufficient to get the engineer off the case. These
        types of challenges quickly become personal -- a battle between
        the engineer and the laws of nature.
<!--
    <P>
        Engineers will go without food and hygiene for days to solve a
        problem. (Other times just because they forgot.) And when they
        succeed in solving the problem they will experience an ego rush
        that is better than sex -- and I'm including the kind of sex where
        other people are involved.
-->
    <P>
        Nothing is more threatening to the engineer than the suggestion
        that somebody has more technical skill. Normal people sometimes
        use that knowledge as a lever to extract more work from the
        engineer. When an engineer says that something can't be done (a
        code phrase that means it's not fun to do), some clever normal
        people have learned to glance at the engineer with a look of
        compassion and pity and say something along these lines: "I'll
        ask Bob to figure it out. He knows how to solve difficult
        technical problems."
    <P>
        At that point it is a good idea for the normal person to not stand
        between the engineer and the problem. The engineer will set upon
        the problem like a starved Chihuahua on a pork chop.
