        breadboard kits.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Equipment</h3>

Familiarize yourself with the following components of your lab
equipment toolbox:

<ul>
    <li><b>Breadboard:</b> This device is designed for rapid
        prototyping and construction of circuits.
        <ul>
            <li> There are three power terminals (or binding posts) near the top
                of the board.
            </li>
            <li> The board has a series of isolated tie points (holes or sockets
                aligned in a grid) that are connected together to provide continuous
                bus structures or strips. Component leads or wires are inserted
                into these sockets and held firmly enough to create a solid contact
                without requiring soldering.
            </li>
            <li> There are four horizontal strips of connected tie points (two
                each across the top and bottom of the board). These sockets are
                connected into a distribution bus and are typically used as power
                strips or as common ground. All the holes in each 1/4 of a strip are
                connected together.
            </li>
            <li> There are 128 vertical strips of 5 holes - each of the holes in
                a strip is connected. These are used to wire together discrete
                components.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>Make sure you understand the built-in connections on the
            breadboard and how to use them effectively and correctly</i>. It
            will be used to wire together the digital circuits used in this
            lab. </p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Power supply:</b> We will be using a conditioned
        5V/adjustable power supply. We will use the fixed 5V lead, not
        the.1.5-12V adjustable range. Note that the power supply must be
        turned on, even when using the fixed lead.
    </li>
    <li><b>Power leads:</b> these have banana clips on each
        end. Use them to connect the power supply to the terminals on the
        breadboard - then connect the terminals to your distribution buses.
    </li>
    <li><b>LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes):</b> LEDs are simple
        optical devices made of gallium-arsenide-phosphide that are used for
        signal detection. Note that the longer lead represents the anode
        side of the device. (In other words, the longer wire goes on the side attached to the positive terminal.)
    </li>

    <li><b>Resistors:</b> Various resistors are provided,
        primarily to limit the current to the LEDs. Most LEDs will burn
        out quickly if their current exceeds 50 mA; we will use much less than
        that in these labs. Each resistor has a set of color-coded stripes.
        These stripes indicate the amount of resistance in Ohms. See <a target="_top"
                                                                        HREF="http://xtronics.com/kits/rcode.htm">
            http://xtronics.com/kits/rcode.htm</a> for information on how to read
        the color code.
    </li>

    <li><b>Wire kit</b>: Various length wires with pre-bent ends
        to facilitate circuit wiring.
    </li>

    <li><b>Wrist straps:</b> These are provided to guard against
        static electricity (CMOS chips can be damaged by excess static). <i>Ground
            these to the breadboard or negative terminal and wear one whenever you
            are handling IC chips.</i></li>

    <li><b>Logic chips:</b> Our circuits will be composed of gates
        implemented in logic chips of the HCT family, which stands for
        High-speed CMOS TTL-compatible (CMOS is Complementary Metal-Oxide
        Semiconductor and TTL is Transistor-Transistor Logic). They are
        pin compatible with the 74LS (Low-power Schottky) family of logic
        chips. Although CMOS chips are vulnerable to static, they consume
        considerably less power, fit more functionality per chip, and can be
        powered by a wider range of voltage than TTL or TTL/LS chips.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="listHeader"><i>Some important guidelines when working with CMOS:</i></p>

<ul>
    <li> Avoid touching the pins.</li>

    <li> Never connect an input signal to a CMOS chip when the power
        is off. In other words, make sure there is power flowing through
        pins 7 and 14 before connecting input wires to a power source.
    </li>

    <li> Do not remove power if an input signal is still present. In
        other words, disconnect power to your inputs before disconnecting
        power to the chip or breadboard.
    </li>
    <li> Unused inputs may pick up stray signals. Stray signals
        can cause rapid oscillation in logic state, consuming excessive
        power. If chip behavior is erratic, or the chip becomes very hot,
        connect unused inputs to ground.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="listHeader"><i>To use integrated circuits with a breadboard:</i></p>

<ul>
    <li> Align the leads (pins) of the chip with the contact points on
        each side of the center, such that each pin is isolated.
    </li>
    <li><i>Gently</i> press the center of the IC until it drops into
        position.
    </li>
    <li> Remove the IC by using the chip extractor to carefully pry it
        up until it can be lifted free.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3> Creating a Simple Circuit</h3>

<p><em>Before creating your first circuit, there is something you need to
    understand about LEDs:</em> Normal, incandescent light bulbs produce
    light by resisting the flow of electricity. This resistance produces
    heat, which causes the filament to glow. When you drain a flashlight
    battery, most of the energy in the battery has been converted to heat.</p>

<p> In contrast, LEDs produce light by exciting electrons causing them to
    release photons ("light particles"). This process uses use very
    little energy. Consequently, LEDs do not resist the flow of
    electricity. When there is nothing to resist the flow of electricity,
    the amount of current (think "number of electrons per second")
    increases. You may remember the following formula:</p>


<p style='align: center'><b>V = IR</b></p>

<p> Or, in other words, voltage equals current (in amps) times
    resistance (in Ohms).

<ol style="display: none">
    <li> Normal List</li>
</ol>

<ol class="customx reset">
    <li> Suppose you hooked up a red LED with a resistance of 1 micro Ohm
        (1x10<sup>-6</sup> Ohms) directly to a 5 volt battery. Using the formula above, how much
      current will be drawn from the battery?</li>
</ol>

<p>The power supply cannot produce that many amps. However, the 1 amp
    that the power supply can deliver is enough to damage the LED and
    (more importantly) the breadboard. Therefore, <em>always</em> add
    a resistor as shown in Figure 1.1 to limit the amount of current
    through the diode to about 10mA.</p>

<ol class="customx" start=2>
    <li> LEDs typically use a fixed amount of energy, referred to as the
        "voltage drop". A red LED has a voltage drop of 1.7V, leaving 3.3
        volts to "push" the current through the resistor. How strong of a
        resistor should you add to the circuit to limit the current to 10mA?
    <LI> What value resistor should you use for a green LED with a
        voltage-drop of 2.1 volts?
    <li> What are the color codes for the resistors in the preceding
        questions?
    </li>
</ol>
<P>

    Now that you understand the importance of using resistors, construct
    the circuit shown in Figure 1-1 and described below.
    <img class="center" src="Fig1-1.gif" height="263" width="274" alt="Simple LED">
<ul>
    <li> Connect the power supply to the positive and negative terminals
        on the breadboard.
    </li>
    <li> Connect each terminal to a distribution bus (one of the
        horizontal rows).
    </li>
    <li> Insert the appropriate resistor into the breadboard and connect it to
        positive.
    </li>
    <li> Insert an LED and connect the resistor to the LED.The
        LED is a diode, and will only work when the longer wire is connected to a path to positive voltage.
    </li>
    <li> Connect the LED to ground.</li>
    <li> When the circuit is constructed correctly, the LED will glow
        visibly whenever power is applied. If it glows dimly, you chose the
        wrong resistor.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3> Using Integrated Circuits</h3>
Integrated circuits typically contain multiple logic gates and hence
provide multiple input and output connections (called pin outs).
Find an IC labeled 74HCT08 - this is a quad 2-input AND gate.
That means there are four AND gates within the chip, each of which
takes two inputs. Each AND gate implements the Boolean AND
function.<br>

<p>If the chip is positioned with the notch to your left, then pin
    number 1 in the lower-left corner. The remaining pins are numbered
    sequentially and counterclockwise.

<p>
    Integrated circuits need power in order to open and close the
    transistors that implement the gates they contain. Pin 14 (in the
    upper-left corner) is called V<sub>CC</sub>. This is where you
    connect the source voltage. Pin 7 (in the lower-right corner) is where
    ground voltage is applied. In other words, Pin 14 must be
    connected through a breadboard terminal and power distribution strip
    to the positive terminal of the battery. Likewise pin 7 must be
    connected to the negative terminal of the battery. <i>Never place a
    load (current and voltage) onto a pin unless the chip is also powered
    through pins 7 and 14.</i></P>


<p>The figure below shows the pinout for chip 74HCT08 --- a chip
    containing four 2-input AND gates. Pins 1 and 2 are the input to the
    first of the four AND gates, pin 3 is the output. Likewise, pins
    4 and 5 are inputs to an AND gate with output pin 6, pins 9 and 10
    (input) connect with pin 8 (output), and pins 12 and 13 (input) go
    with pin 11 (output).</p>

<img class="center" src="74008.gif" alt="AND pinout">

<p>Your kits also include the following integrated circuits:</p>

    <tr>
        <td> 74HCT86</td>
        <td> XOR</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>They are all quad 2-input ICs - meaning there are four gates within each chip, where each gate takes two input.
  <a href='http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~kurmasz/Teaching/Courses/General/CIS351/ReferenceDocuments/Pinouts'>This page</a> shows the pinouts for these chips.
</p>


<p>To investigate the operation of an integrated circuit that
    implements the AND function, construct the following circuit (Figure
    1-3 gives the schematic): </p>

<img class="center" src="Fig1-3.gif" height="265" width="331" ALT="AND gate and LED">

<ul>
    <li> Carefully insert a 74HCT08 IC into the break in the breadboard so
        that each pin sits in its own strip.
    </li>
    <li> Connect the power supply between pins 7 and 14, with the positive
        terminal on pin 14.
    </li>
    <li> Connect a 330-ohm resistor from output pin 3, then to an LED,
        which is then connected to ground.
    </li>
    <li> Connect two wires to the input pins 1 and 2. Using these
        wires, connect both inputs to 0V (ground) and record the logical state of the
        LED. (In other words, is it on or off?) Then connect both inputs to 5V (HIGH) and record the logical
        state of the LED. Then connect pin 1 to LOW and pin 2 to HIGH and
        note the LED. Finally, swap the input wires and record the state
        of the LED.
    </li>
</ul>
Perform the following:
<ol start="5">
    <li> Construct a truth table from your observations.</li>
    <li> Take the wires attached to pins 1 and 2 and leave the other
        ends floating in the air. Describe the effect of having these
        "floating inputs". (To get some more interesting behavior, grab the
        floating ends with your fingers and wiggle them.)
</OL>

<h3>Switches</h3>

You may find it convenient to use switches to control whether an input
wire has a "1" or a "0" on it; however, as you noticed, floating
inputs can cause erratic behavior. In the Resources section of the
course web page, the page <a href='http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~kurmasz/Teaching/Courses/General/CIS351/ReferenceDocuments/Switches/switches.html'>Using Switches</a>
explains how to correctly use the two types of switches in your kit.

<OL start="7">
    <li> Add switches to the circuit you built (the one shown in
        Figure 1-3). You may use either dip switches or momentary
        switches. Demonstrate to the instructor or lab assistant that
        your circuit works correctly, then attach a photo of your
        circuit to your lab report.
</OL>

<H3>Experiment</H3>

<OL start="8">

    <LI> Get a random IC from me. Replace your 74HCT08 with the new
        chip. Construct a truth table from your observations. Identify the
        type of gates the chip contains. (Your writeup needs to include the
        letter on the chip.)
</OL>

<h3>Creating a more complex combinatorial circuit</h3>
Digital logic is implemented by using basic logic gates as building blocks
to create more complex circuits. A combinatorial circuit is a set
of gates whose output function depends only on the values of its current
inputs (i.e., there is no storage or feedback involved in the system).
The following circuit is a common combinatorial circuit.
<p>You will need 2 quad NAND IC's (74HCT00), 2 resistors, and 2 LEDs
    to construct it. I suggest using DIP switches in the "pull-down"
    configuration to control the values of A and B. Remember to use 4.7K
    ohm resistors for your switches.
<ul>
    <li>
        Connect inputs A and B to NAND gate 1.
    </li>

    <li>
        Connect the output C of NAND gate 1 and input A to NAND gate 2. Connect
        the output C and input B to NAND gate 3. Connect the output C of
        NAND gate 1 to both inputs of NAND gate 4. Designate the output of
        NAND gate 4 as Y.
    </li>

    <li>
        Connect the output of NAND gate 2 and the output of NAND gate 3 to NAND
        gate 5. Designate the output of NAND gate 5 as X. See Figure
        2-3 below.
    </li>

    <li>
        Connect two LEDs as before to both outputs Y and X of the circuit.
        Place the LED for output Y to the left of the LED for output X.
    </li>

    <li>
        Apply power and test the circuit.
    </li>
</ul>

<ol start=9>


    <li>
        Determine the truth table from observation. Place the column
        for <code>Y</code> to the <em>left</em> of the column
        for <code>X</code>. In other words, treat <code>YX</code> as
        a two-bit number.
    </li>

    <li>
        Using your observations as a guide, describe what simple operation
        this circuit implements. (Hint: Place the LED for output <em>y</em>
        to the left of the LED for output <em>x</em>.)
    </li>

    <li>Demonstrate your circuit to the instructor (or lab assistant).
    </li>

    <!-- <li>Design another simple circuit that does something
       "useful". (Your circuit does need not cure hunger. It just
       needs to be more interesting than a random truth table.) Submit
       a diagram of your circuit. You may, but are not required to,
       implement your circuit on your breadboard. -->

    <!-- <li> Move one or two wires so that, at all times, exactly one LED is
    on. (Which light is on and which is off can change depending on the
    inputs.)  Show on your labeled schematic which wires you moved and
    where.
    -->

<h3>
Designing a Simple Controller</h3>
The final aspect of this introduction to combinatorial circuits is the
design phase; using simple digital logic to create more complex circuits.
Based on the knowledge gained above, you are to design and construct a
simple digital controller. The controller is to be used to activate
a device when a particular set of input conditions is true. It should
have the following set of characteristics:
<ul>
<li>
the controller takes four inputs (A, B, C, and D) and has one output (X)</li>

<li>
the device control line (output X) must be HIGH whenever input A is ON
and input D is OFF and either input B or input C (or both) is ON</li>
</ul>
Design and implement the controller:
<ol START=13>
<li>
Draw a labeled schematic of your circuit specifying IC numbers and pin
numbers.</li>
</ol>
Test your circuit and <b>demonstrate it to the instructor</b>.
