<h3> Overview</h3>

<p>The purpose of this lab is to provide a "hands-on" introduction to
  modern technologies for storing digital data. The lab will
  investigate basic storage device structure and function by building
  latches and experimenting with flip-flops. These simple devices
  will then be combined with combinatorial logic gates to construct
  sequential circuits. <i>Voila!</i> A state machine is born.</p>

<h3> Simple Storage Devices</h3>

<p>The first and simplest storage device
  we will consider is the S-R latch. It can be constructed using
  relatively simple logic; for example, the version presented in lecture
  used two NOR gates with feedback circuits. Figure 3-1 below
  gives the logic diagram.</p>

<img class="center" src="Fig3-1.gif" height="273" width="427" alt="NOR latch">

<p><b>Important</b>: Note that the pinout of a NOR gate integrated circuit
  (74HC02) differs from the pinouts of the AND and NAND gate ICs used in
  previous labs. <!-- Figure 3-2 gives the pinout of a quad 2-input NOR
gate IC.  (Remember, this diagram shows the gate input/output to which each pin belongs.  It does <em>not</em> represent where the pins physically lie on the chip.) -->
</p>

<img class="center" src="74002.gif" alt="NOR pinout">

<p class='listHeader'>To investigate the operation of an S-R latch, construct the circuit shown above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect inputs <code>R</code> and <code>S</code> to switches (either momentary or dip switches).
  <span class='inline-important'>Remember that each switch needs a resistor!</span>
</li>
  
  <li> Connect both the Q and Q' output lines to LEDs.  
      <span class='inline-important'>Don't forget the resistors for each LED!</span>
      Hint:  Use different colored
        LEDs for the two outputs.</li>
</ul>


<ol>
  <li>Demonstrate your circuit to the instructor or lab assistant.
  </li>

  <li> Notice that, unlike the combinatorial circuits we have discussed
    in class, the output of the S-R latch depends on both the inputs, and
    the current state of the device. A <em>characteristic table</em> is
    used to specify the output of the device in terms of both its input
    and current state. Determine, by observing the state of the LEDs,
    the characteristic table of the device.

  <li> What happens to Q and Q' when both inputs are set to logic 1?</li>
  <li> Explain how the circuit produces the observed result when <code>R=1</code> and <code>S=1</code>. (In
    other words write a couple paragraphs explaining why the output of
    this circuit makes sense given the defined behavior of its
    component gates when <code>R=1</code> and <code>S=1</code>.)
  </li>

  <li> The book claims that setting both inputs to 1 produces an "indeterminate" result.
    <ol>
      <li> Describe a specific sequence of input values for R and S that could lead to Q being in an indeterminate (or
        random), but stable, state. (Hint: Consider what happens when R and S both change values "simultaneously".)
      </li>
      <li> Describe the random state and the cause of the randomness.</li>
    </ol>
    I'm going to be very particular about how this questions is written. You will probably want to have another group
    read your answer to make sure it is clear. Note: I'm not looking for a description of any intermediate states. I'm
    only interested in final, stable, states.
  </li>
</ol>


<h3> Flip-flops</h3>

<p>As described in class, the D flip-flop is a useful device for storing
  one bit of data. It does not suffer from the indeterminate state
  observed in the S-R latch. The logic device that will be used in
  this experiment is the 74HCT74, a dual D-type flip-flop with Set and
  Reset and a positive-edge trigger. The "dual" means there are two
  D flip-flops in the IC, the "Set and Reset" means that there are pins to
  Set and Reset the device, and "positive-edge trigger" indicates that a
  bit present on the D input will be latched into the flip-flop at the
  leading edge of a clock pulse.</p>

<p>The pinout of the D flip-flop is very different from the gates used
  previously. See Figure 3-3 below for the details of the
  pinout. Power is connected across pins 7 and 14 as usual.
  For flip-flop #1, pin 2 is the D (<b>Data</b>) input. The
  outputs Q and Q' are at pins 5 and 6 respectively.
  The <b>Clock</b> signal (CLK) is input to pin 3. Finally, pin 1
  (labeled CLR) provides the Clear, or <b>Reset</b> function. Pin
  4 (labeled PR) provides the Preset, or <b>Set</b> function.
  <span class='inline-important'>Both the Set and Clear inputs are active-<em>LOW</em></span>, which means
  they are in effect whenever a logic 0 is applied. In other words,
  connecting Set to ground will instantly set the state of the flip-flop
  to 1. No clock pulse is necessary to use set and reset. This entire
  organization is repeated, using different pins, for flip-flop #2. </p>

<img class="center" src="74074.gif" alt="D-latch pinout">


<p class="listHeader">Construct the following circuit:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Connect power to the chip as usual and connect LEDs to monitor
    the Q and Q' outputs.
  </li>
<!--- ' stray apostrophe to make syntax highlighter happy ---> 

  <li> Connect the Preset and Clear, and D pins to a DIP switch
    using a "pull-down" (i.e., 0 when the DIP switch is "off")
    setup. <span class='inline-important'>Remember, there is a page on the course web page
    showing <a href='https://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~kurmasz/Teaching/Courses/General/CIS351/ReferenceDocuments/Switches/switches.html'>how to use switches</a></span>.
  </li>

  <li> Test your DIP switch setup by using Preset and Clear to set Q
    to 1, then 0.
  </li>
  <li> Connect the clock to a momentary switch using a "pull-down"
    (i.e., 0 when the switch is up, and 1 when it is pressed)
    configuration.
  </li>
  <li> Test to see that the clock and the "D" switch work as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Show the operation of the D flip-flop by completing the timing diagrams
  below: (Note: The diagrams below contain 8 vertical dotted lines.
  If you see fewer than 8 such lines, your web browser truncated the diagram.)</p>

<ol start="6">

  <li> This first diagram shows a typical clocked usage of the flip
    flop. Note that, for this diagram, PRE and CLR are always 1.
    <p><img src="timing_diagram_dff_only.jpeg" alt="Diagram 1"></p></li>

  <li> This diagram shows typical preset / clear behavior. Note that
    the clock remains at 0 for the first half of the diagram.
    <p><img src="timing_diagram_dff_prclr1.jpeg" alt="Diagram 2"></p></li>

  <li> This diagram shows what happens when preset and clear are both low at the same time.
    The results of setting preset and clear to low at the same time are not defined, so the behavior may not be
    consistent.
    <p><img src="timing_diagram_dff_prclr2.jpeg" alt="Diagram 3"></p></li>
</ol>

<h3> Creating a Sequential Circuit</h3>

<p>This last experiment provides a good example of the way storage devices
  and logic gates are used together to create a sequential circuit.
  It uses a combination of feedback (the current state of a storage
  device) together with combinatorial logic to create a device
  implementing a useful function.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Construct the circuit given in Figure 3-4 below:
    <ul>
    <li><span class='inline-important'>Remember to set PRE and CLR to 1.</span>
      <li> Use LEDs to monitor the Q outputs of the two flip-flops. (Use different colors.)</li>
      <li> <span class='inline-important'>Place the LED for A1 <em><b>to the left of</b></em> the LED for A0.</span</li>
      <li>Wire both clock inputs to a single momentary switch to synchronize
        the flip-flops on the same rising clock pulse.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Repeatedly apply <b>Clock</b> pulses to the circuit and observe
    the two Q outputs until you have discovered the pattern.
  </li>
  <li> You may need to refer to the web page showing <a href='https://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~kurmasz/Teaching/Courses/General/CIS351/ReferenceDocuments/Pinouts'>pinouts</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="9">

  <li> Report your observations using a characteristic table..</li>
  <li> Based on your observations, what useful circuit have you
    constructed? Hint: <span class='inline-important'>Make sure your LED for A1 is to the left of the LED
    for A0.</span>
  </li>

  <li>Demonstrate your circuit to the instructor or lab assistant.
  </li>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p class='listHeader'>If your circuit doesn't work as expected, work through this checklist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do all LEDs have resistors?</li>
  <li>Are all LED resistors less than 1000 Ohms?</li>
  <li>Are all chips inserted with the notch to the left?</li>
  <li>Is pin 14 of each chip wired to the positive power bus?</li>
  <li>Is pin 7 of each chip wired to the negative power bus?</li>
  <li>Are there any floating inputs?</li>
  <li>Does every switch have a resistor?</li>
  <li>Is every switch's resistor at least 1000 Ohms?</li> <!-- ' commented "closing" quote to make syntax highlighter happy-->
  
  <li>Does every flip-flop input pin have a valid signal?</li>
  <li>Are PRE and CLR set to 1 (either hard-wired to 1, or configured to use a 
  switch that is currently turned "on")?</li>
