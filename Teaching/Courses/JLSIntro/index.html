<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction to JLS</h2>

<p>Although breadboards are a lot of fun to
    <del>play</del>
    experiment with, it is very difficult to build anything but very small
    circuits. (More accurately, it is almost impossible to debug circuits
    with more than 10 or 15 wires.) Therefore, you will use simulation
    software when designing and building larger circuits. In particular,
    this you will be using a circuit simulator from
    <a href="http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~pop" target="_top">Dave Poplawski</a>
    at
    <a href="http://www.cs.mtu.edu" target="_top">Michigan Tech</a>
    named
    <em>JLS</em>
    (<em>J</em>ava
    <em>L</em>ogic
    <em>S</em>imulator).
</p>

<p class="listHeader">The primary objectives for this lab are</p>

<ul>
    <li>to get JLS set up in your environment,</li>
    <li>to learn how to use JLS,</li>
    <li>to learn how to test your circuits using either the <a
            klink="jlsct_webloc" href=""><code>JLSCircuitTester</code></a>
        suite or the new DLUnit, and
    </li>
    <li>to build a circuit using JLS.
</ul>

<h2>Pre-lab</h2>

<p>As soon as you arrive in lab, demonstrate that you have created at least one circuit using JLS.</p>

<h2>Set up JLS</h2>

The JLS simulator is written in Java and can, therefore, be installed in
user space and run on almost any machine with the Java 5.0 run-time
environment. One exception: You may need a two-button mouse to run JLS
on a Mac. (Java for the Mac does not process ctrl-click as a right-click
in the way Windows and Linux do. Many important features now have
keyboard shortcuts; but, you may find yourself in need of a feature
accessible only with a right-click.)


<p>All the JLS code is contained in <code>JLS.jar</code>. If you are using the EOS
    lab, you will find it in <code kkey="jls_loc"></code>. The
    easiest way to run JLS is to put this directory in your path. (For most
    of you, the best way to do this is to add the line <code>export&nbsp;PATH=$PATH:<span kkey="jls_bin"></span></code>
    to the end of your <code>.bashrc</code>.) There is a script named <code>jls</code>
    in this directory that sets up the java classpath and launches JLS. This
    directory also contains other scripts that will make your life in this
    course much easier. If you object to adding this directory to your path,
    you can also launch JLS with this command:<br>
    <code>java&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;<span kkey="jls_loc"></span>/JLS.jar</code>.


<p>To run JLS on your own machine, download <a
        klink="jls_webloc" href=""><code>JLS.jar</code></a>. You
    run JLS by typing <code>java -jar <em>jlsDir</em>/JLS.jar</code>,
    where <code><em>jlsDir</em></code> is the directory into which you saved
    <code>JLS.jar</code>. <!-- The flag <code>-Xmx256m</code> tells the JVM to
    use up to 256MB of memory. (The default is 64MB.) If <code>jls</code>
    runs out of memory and crashes, you can change the 256 to something
    larger (however, if you find that 256MB of memory isn't enough, then
    there is a good chance your circuit is not designed well). -->


<p>Regardless of where you run JLS, make sure you have the latest
    version. <span kkey="current_jls_version"></span>


<h2>Learn how to use JLS</h2>

<p>Begin by working through the "Introduction", "Full&nbsp;Adder", and
    "Sign&nbsp;Extender" tutorials. (You may also want to complete the 4-Bit
    Counter tutorial when we get to registers.) You will find all the
    tutorials in the <code>Help->Tutorials</code> menu.</p>

<p class="listHeader">As you work through the tutorial, pay special attention to the
    following details:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name your half adder <code>HalfAdder.jls</code>, <em>not</em> <code>ha</code>
        as suggested by the tutorial.
    </li>
    <li>Name your sum output <code>Sum</code>, <em>not</em> <code>SUM</code>
        as suggested by the tutorial.
    </li>
    <li>Name your full adder <code>FullAdder.jls</code>, <em>not</em> <code>fa</code>
        as suggested by the tutorial.
    </li>
    <li>Importing a sub-circuit inserts a <em>copy</em> of the imported
        sub-circuit into the circuit you are creating. As a result, if you
        later discover a bug in your sub-circuit, you must re-import that
        sub-circuit everywhere. It is not sufficient to simply fix the bug in
        the sub-circuit's <code>jls</code> file. Moral: Thoroughly test your
        sub-circuits before importing them.
    </li>
</ul>

<p> When you are finished, save your half-adder in a file named
    <code>HalfAdder.jls</code>. Make sure the inputs are
    named "<code>A</code>" and "<code>B</code>", and the outputs are
    named "<code>Sum</code>" and "<code>Carry</code>".
    The program I use to help test your circuits requires the circuits to
    present a known interface. (In other words, the program needs to know
    what the input and output pins are named.) If you do not conform to the
    specified interface (i.e., the given circuit and input names), I will
    probably not grade your circuit.</p>


<h2>Learn how to test JLS circuits</h2>

<p>After completing a circuit, your first order of business should be to
    test it by setting the values of the input pins and examining the values
    of the output pins. In fact, it is a good idea to test sub-circuits as
    you build them.</p>

<p>When you have finished building the full adder (as described in the
    tutorial):</p>

<ol>
    <li>Add input pins named <code>InputA</code>, <code>InputB</code>, and
        <code>CarryIn</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Add a "generate test signals" element. (This element is on the
        toolbar to the right of the "pause" element.). Set appropriate values
        for the three input pins. (As an example, one line may look like this:
        <code>InputA 1 end</code>.)
    </li>
    <li>Add watches to all the output pins.</li>
    <li>Place probes on the "Carry" outputs of each component half adder.</li>
    <li>Open the simulator window, run the simulation, and verify that the
        resulting output is correct.
    </li>
    <li>Change the scale factor from 1 to 5 and observe what happens.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the simulator window is a good way to check a few example
    input/output pairs, or to track down bugs; however, trying to thoroughly
    test a circuit using this technique would be very tedious and time
    consuming. Consequently, we provide <code>JLSCircuitTester</code>, a
    suite of programs to automate the running of many tests. (Think of it as
    JUnit for hardware.)</p>

<div class="DLUnit">
    <p>
    <h3>IMPORTANT!</h3></p>

    <p class="listHeader">This semester, you have a choice of using either <code>JLSCircuitTester</code>, or
        an an "alpha" version of a new tool called <code>DLUnit</code>. <code>DLUnit</code> will replace <code>JLSCircuitTester</code>
        sometime in the next 24 months. The main advantages of <code>DLUnit</code> over <code>JLSCircuitTester</code>
        are</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is easier to install and run (i.e., you don't need the bash/batch scripts to make it work).</li>
        <li>It is easier to write tests. They are JUnit tests (as opposed to <code>JLSCircuitTester</code>, which uses a
            custom syntax).
        <li>The output is easier to understand.</li>
        <li>It supports both JLS and <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/">Logisim</a>. (Logisim is similar to JLS,
            but more popular.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are already familiar with <code>JLSCircuitTester</code> because you've used it in other classes, I
        suggest you continute to use it --- no need to learn a new tool. If you've never used <code>JLS</code> or
        <code>JLSCircuitTester</code> before, I suspect you will be happier with <code>DLUnit</code>.</p>

    <p class="listHeader">Note, however, that <code>DLUnit</code> is still a work in progress. It should work just fine
        for the course
        projects; but,
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The error messages are still a bit terse</li>
        <li>There are most certainly bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you chose to use <code>DLUnit</code>, just copy this <code>.jar</code> file from EOS:
        <code><span kkey="jls_bin"></span></code></p>
</div>

<p>I will use the <code>JLSCircuitTester</code> suite to test your
    circuits. Programs in this suite run circuits many times with different
    inputs, and compare the resulting outputs to known values. For this lab,
    you will be using a program called <code>jlsCircuitTester</code>. For
    your convenience, I have installed this suite in <code kkey="jls_bin"></code>.
    If you are using your own machine, you will need to download <a
            klink="jlsct_webloc" href=""><code>JLSCircuitTester</code></a>
    and follow the installation instructions.</p>

<p>Practice using this testing setup by testing the half adder you built
    while completing the tutorial. (Again, make sure the file, inputs, and
    outputs are all named correctly.)</p>

<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="testHalfAdder">testHalfAdder</a>.</li>
    <li>Run <code>jlsCircuitTester HalfAdder.jls testHalfAdder</code>.</li>
</ol>

<div class="DLUnit">
    <p>If you are using <code>DLUnit</code>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download <a href="HalfAdderTest.java">HalfAdderTest.java</a>.</li>
        <li>Compile the test: <code>javac -cp DLUnit.jar HalfAdderTest.java</code></li>
        <li>Run <code>java -jar DLUnit.jar HalfAdder.jls HalfAdderTest.class</code>.</li>
    </ol>
</div>


<p>If you want to better understand how <code>testHalfAdder</code>
    specifies inputs to the circuits, run <code>jlsCircuitTester</code>
    with the <code>--verbose</code> parameter.</p>

<p>To make sure you understand how <code>jlsCircuitTester</code> works,
    deliberately introduce a bug into <code>HalfAdder.jls</code> (e.g.,
    replace the <code>XOR</code> gate with an <code>AND</code> gate) and
    re-run the test script. (Then fix the circuit once you know what happens
    when there is an error.)</p>


<h2>Build your own circuit</h2>

<p>Now that you have had some practice using JLS, it's time to build
    your own circuit. Build a circuit named "<code>UnsignedFullAdder_16bit</code>"
    that adds two 16-bit unsigned integers. The simplest way to complete
    this lab is to implement a ripple-carry adder. However, the upcoming
    project will offer extra points to those who build an adder that is
    faster than <code>O(n)</code>. Therefore, you may want to get a head
    start on the project by building a faster adder.</p>

<p>To keep the design manageable, you may want to use one or more
    sub-circuits (e.g., connect four 4-bit adders, or two 8-bit adders). If
    you do use sub-circuits, notice that you can unbundle buses into
    arbitrary groups. For example, you can take a 16-bit bus and split it
    into 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, and 12-15. In the "Create unbundler" dialog, select
    "Group bits" instead of "Single bits". (See the "Sign Extender" tutorial
    built into JLS.)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Name the inputs "<code>InputA</code>","<code>InputB</code>", and "<code>CarryIn</code>".</li>

    <li>Name the outputs "<code>Output</code>" and "<code>CarryOut</code>".
        (If you do not name the inputs and outputs correctly, the test script
        will not run.) The "<code>CarryOut</code>" output should be 1 if, and
        only if, there is an overflow.
    </li>

    <li>Test your circuit using <a href="testUnsignedFullAdder_16bit"><code>testUnsignedFullAdder16_bit</code></a>
        <span class="DLUnit">(or <a
                href="SampleUnsigned16BitAdderTest.java"><code>SampleUnsigned16BitAdderTest.java</code></a>)</span>.
        If the test script doesn't work without modification, then you either
        named your circuit, inputs, or outputs incorrectly.
    </li>

    <li><code>testUnsignedFullAdder16_bit</code> will not completely test
        your circuit. Add as many tests as necessary to be confident your
        circuit works.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Demonstrate your circuit (and tests) to the instructor.</li>

    <li>Add a text box to your <code>jls</code> files that includes
        <ul>
            <li>your name,</li>
            <li>the file name,</li>
            <li>the assignment name, and</li>
            <li>the assignment due date.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--
        <li>Use the Print->Export Image feature to produce a <code>.jpeg</code>
            of your half adder, full adder, and any sub-circuits you design. Use
            the "Just Visible Window" option to print your circuit. Using the
            "Entire Circuit" option will print one copy of each sub-circuit. That
            means if you have imported a 1-bit full adder 16 times, you will get 16
            copies of your adder!
        </li>

        <li>Submit hard copies of the images.</li>
    -->
    <li>Submit the <code>jls</code> files, and any additional test files
        you used, using Blackboard's Assignment Manager.
    </li>
</ul>
