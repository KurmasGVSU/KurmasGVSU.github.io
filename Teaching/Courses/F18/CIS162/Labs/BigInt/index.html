<p>Regular Java integers (i.e., <code>int</code>s) take up 32 bits of memory and, therefore, can hold only integers
  between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. Java integers are only 32 bits because, at the time Java was designed, most
  computers were build to operate on at most 32 bits at one time. (Today, 64-bit machines are most common.) Such 32- and
  64-bit operations happen very quickly in hardware. Storing and operating on larger numbers must be done using
  software. </p>


Today, you are going to implement your own version of Java's
<code>BigInteger</code> class. This class will allow you to store,
add, multiply, compare, and print arbitrarily large integers. One
common use of Java's <code>BigInteger</code> class is to handle the
very large prime numbers used in cryptography.
<P>


  In order to store a <code>BigInteger</code> in Java, you must
  represent it using a group of "smaller" variables. For this lab, you
  must use an array of <code>int</code>egers to store your
  <code>BigInteger</code> Here are two ways you can use your array:

<ul>
  <li><b>Base-10</b>: Store the integer in the same way you would
    write it: Each array element contains one digit between 0 and 9.
    Because you are representing the integer the same way you do on
    paper, you then perform addition and multiplication using the same
    technique you use to add and multiply numbers by hand. This
    technique is the most obvious, and will be the easiest to implement
  </li>

  <li><b>Base-2^32</b>: Suppose you have an integer so large that it
    takes 70 bits to represent. You could represent this large integer
    using three, normal, 32 bit-integers "pushed together". When doing
    this, you are effectively using your array to represent your
    <code>BigInteger</code> as a "base 2147483648" number. The
    algorithms to implement some of the methods are <em>very</em>
    difficult (especially the constructor), but they will run much more
    quickly. If you choose this path, let me know and I will give you
    more specific instructions.
  </li>

  <!---
  <LI> <B>Chinese Remainder Theorem</B>: Perhaps the most efficient
  implementation is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  The
  mathematics to implement this technique are not difficult (easy
  enough to be done in two hours); however, the techniques will
  probably be something very new to you.  If you are curious, ask and
  I'll provide you a copy of a textbook that describes the
  technique.<P></LI> --->
</ul>


<h3> Writing <code>BigInteger</code></h3>

Begin by cloning <code>https://github.com/KurmasGVSU/BigIntLab.git</code>
(or, by creating a new project and adding
<a href="MyBigInteger.java"><code>MyBigInteger.java</code></a> and
<a href="MyBigIntegerTest.java"><code>MyBigIntegerTest.java</code></a>
to it).

Implement <em>and <a href="#test">test</a></em> the methods <em>in the
  order listed below</em>. This lab will be much easier to write and
debug if you follow the directions. Trust me. To reduce complexity,
your implementation will (1) handle only positive integers and
(2) assume that all <code>BigIntegers</code> have 1024 characters
(including leading zeros, if necessary).

<ul>
  <!--
  <LI> <CODE>public static void fill_with_0(int array[])</CODE>:
  A <code>static</code> method that fills every slot
  in <code>array</code> with 0. -->

  <li><code>BigInteger(String)</code>: A constructor taking
    a <code>String</code> as input.
  </li>

  <li><code> String toString()</code>: Return a <code>String</code>
    representing the <code>BigInteger</code> object.
  </li>

  <li><code>static boolean equals(BigInteger n1, BigInteger n2)</code>:
    Returns <code>true</code> if and only if <code>n1</code> is equal
    to <code>n2</code>.
  </li>

  <li><code>static boolean lessThan(BigInteger n1, BigInteger
    n2)</code>: Returns <code>true</code> if and only if <code>n1</code>
    is less than <code>n2</code>.

  <li><code>static BigInteger add(BigInteger n1, BigInteger
    n2)</code>: Return a <code>BigInteger</code> equal to the sum
    of <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code>.


  <li><code>static BigInteger multiply(BigInteger n1, BigInteger
    n2)</code>: Return a <code>BigInteger</code> equal to the product
    of <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code>. (<em>extra credit</em>. Remove the <code>@Ignore</code> tags from the
    tests if you decide to attempt this method.)

</ul>

<he><a name="Test">Testing</a> <code>MyBigInteger</code></he>

Test your <code>MyBigInteger</code> class using <a href="MyBigIntegerTest.java"><code>MyBigIntegerTest.java</code></a>.
Pay attention to how each method is tested, what test cases are chosen, and what integers are chosen for each tests.

<H3>Submisson</h3>

Demonstrate to the instructor that your test script runs correctly.
Then submit a printout of the code.

<P>

<h2> For More practice</h2>

Here are some exercises that will help you prepare for the
Final Exam:

<ul>
  <li><code>static BigInteger subtract(BigInteger n1, BigInteger n2)</code>.
  <li><code>static BigInteger divide(BigInteger n1, BigInteger n2)</code>.
  <li><code>static BigInteger mod(BigInteger n1, BigInteger m)</code>.
  <li><code>double doubleValue()</code>.
  <li> Add the ability to handle negative numbers.

  <li> Make the array <code>digits</code> just big enough to hold the
    number (as opposed to fixing the size at 1024).
  </li>

</ul>
