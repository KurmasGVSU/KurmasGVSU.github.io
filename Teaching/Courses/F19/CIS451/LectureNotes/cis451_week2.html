<h2 id="cisc-vs-risc">CISC vs. RISC</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="to-me">Re-read Stallings 15.4</li>
  <li>Fewer slower instructions vs. more faster instructions</li>
  <li class="question">What is potential benefit of fewer slower instructions?
    <ul>
      <li>Less repeated work (e.g., instruction fetch)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="question">What is balance today?
    <ul>
      <li>Mostly RISC, with a few favorite CISC instructions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Arguments for CISC
    <ol>
      <li>Compiler simplification:  Compiler has less work to do since it
needs to generate fewer instructions.
        <ul>
          <li><span class="question">What is the counter-argument?</span> 
It difficult hard to program compilers to take advantage of esoteric instructions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>CISC programs are smaller.
        <ul>
          <li><span class="question">What is the counter-argument?</span> Fewer instructions yes; but, those instructions
tend to be larger.</li>
          <li><span class="question"> Why do the instructions tend to be larger?</span>
            <ul>
              <li>More addressing modes and more use of memory access tend to require more bits.</li>
              <li>More op-codes also requires more bits.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Suppose you have a RISC and a CISC processor and are asked to decide which is “better?”<br />
<span class="question">What makes one CPU “better” than another?</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Purchase Cost</li>
      <li>Total cost of ownership</li>
      <li>Throughput</li>
      <li>Energy efficiency</li>
      <li>Reliability</li>
      <li>Speed / Time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="question">What are the different times than can be measured when timing a
  program?
    <ul>
      <li>Wall clock</li>
      <li>CPU time (time when program has CPU, excluding when processes is blocked on I/O or cache misses)</li>
      <li>Our model will be “wall clock” time since we’ll assume only
one program running on CPU</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For CPUs we make it simple: latency — How fast can a CPU complete a
given task.  (Task may be one user’s specific task, or processing a
batch of a million Amazon orders.)</li>
  <li>Throughput also common.
    <ul>
      <li class="question">What is danger of throughput?
        <ul>
          <li>Starvation for minority</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Performance is the inverse of time:  less time &lt;===&gt; better performance</li>
  <li>Try to avoid using the term “increasing” and “decreasing”.  Notice
  that increasing performance means decreasing execution time
  (latency). Although well-defined, it can cause confusion.
  “Improve” is a better term.</li>
  <li>Avoid using percents
    <ul>
      <li>CPU A completes a task in 10 seconds</li>
      <li>CPU B completes the same task in 15 seconds</li>
      <li class="question">How much faster is A than B?
        <ul>
          <li>50% ?  (<code>(15-10) / 10</code> is 50%)</li>
          <li>33% ?  (<code>(15 - 10)/ 15</code> is 33%)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It’s better to use the term “Speedup”.
        <ul>
          <li>Speedup = <code>original_time / new_time</code></li>
          <li>Switching from B to A results in a speedup of 1.5.</li>
          <li>Switching from A to B results in a speedup of .666.</li>
          <li>A speedup of &lt; 1 represents a slowdown.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>So, now, we time the RISC processor and time the CISC processor and see which one is faster.</li>
  <li class="question">What’s missing?</li>
  <li class="question">What programs do we time?</li>
  <li>Ideally we could exactly reproduce what the user intends to do on that machine.
    <ul>
      <li>Called the “workload”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In practice, we need to choose an approximation of the user’s real workload called a <em>bemchmark</em></li>
  <li>Benchmarks: A set of programs <em>and input</em> that represent a workload.
    <ul>
      <li>Not a perfect representation; but, designed to be a reasonably
close approximation.</li>
      <li>Several types:
        <ul>
          <li>Kernels (short, focused tasks like matrix multiply)</li>
          <li>Synthetic benchmarks (made up lists of tasks designed to stress the CPU)
            <ul>
              <li>TPC-C Database activities for transaction processing.</li>
              <li>TPC-H Decision support queries</li>
              <li>Dhrystone</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Benchmark suites – sets of real programs
            <ul>
              <li>SpecWeb</li>
              <li>SpecInt (our “go-to” benchmark)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SpecInt is a suite of programs that typify what we might do in EOS. (See Figure 1.17 on slide or in textbook.)</li>
  <li class="question">How should we present results in a single number?</li>
  <li class="question">What is the problem with the arithmetic mean? (i.e., “average”)
    <ul>
      <li>It overweights longer programs. Consider a benchmark with two programs:
        <ul>
          <li>P1 that takes about 10 hours to run on CPU A</li>
          <li>P2 takes takes 1.5 hours to run on CPU A.</li>
          <li>Suppose CPU A is 20% faster than B on P1 (i.e., B takes 12 hours), but</li>
          <li>CPU A is 50% slower than CPU B (i.e., B takes 1 hour).</li>
          <li class="question">Which CPU should be be considered “faster”?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Solution:  Use ratios (present each program as “speedup of CPU A over CPU Y).
        <ul>
          <li><code>(time_a / time_y) / (time_b / time_y) = time_a / time_b</code></li>
          <li>That gives <code>.86</code> and <code>1.5</code></li>
          <li>(Notice how the time of the reference machine Y becomes irrelevant?)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">Now, what do we do with those scores?</li>
      <li>Arithmetic mean isn’t the right average. Consider
        <ul>
          <li>CPU A has tasks that take 2 hrs and 3 hrs respectively.</li>
          <li>CPU B has tasks that take 3 hrs and 2 hrs respectively.</li>
          <li>Ratios are <code>.666</code> and <code>1.5</code>.  Which CPU “wins” depends on which one ends up in the denominator.</li>
          <li><strong>Geometric</strong> mean gives the expected result: The CPUs are equal.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="isa-instruction-set-architecture">ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)</h2>

<p>Let’s think about how the design of an ISA (think “machine language”) matters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Suppose you are designing a CPU from scratch.
    <ul>
      <li class="question">What is the first thing/feature/parameter you choose?</li>
      <li>Probably the <em>word size</em>.
        <ul>
          <li class="question">How does the word size affect the rest of the CPU?</li>
          <li class="question">What is the most common word size today?</li>
          <li class="question">What drove the move from 32 to 64 bit machines?
            <ul>
              <li>Address space</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="question">Suppose moving to 64 bit word slows clock period by 5%.  What % of
   instructions must be eliminated?  5%?
            <ul>
              <li>No. Remember 50% loss and 50% gain don’t cancel.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">How many registers should the CPU have?</li>
      <li class="question">What are the consequences of many/few registers?
        <ul>
          <li>Performance (less RAM access)</li>
          <li>More registers requires more resources.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let’s design a basic instruction: <em>add</em>
    <ul>
      <li class="question">How many parameters?</li>
      <li class="question">How few parameters can you have?</li>
      <li class="question">What are benefits of many vs. few?</li>
      <li class="question">What are benefits of one parameter?</li>
      <li class="question">What are benefit of zero parameter?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One parameter add is an <em>accumulator</em> based architecture.
    <ul>
      <li>Notice how this computer emphasized the simplicity of the machine over performance.</li>
      <li>Compare this mindset to the typical mindset today.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Zero parameter add is a stack-based architecture.
    <ul>
      <li>Not a bad idea, but never took off.</li>
      <li>But, there is a stack based architecture today.</li>
      <li><span class="question">What is it?</span>  (Java Virtual Machine)</li>
      <li>Notice how ideas can come back in a new context.</li>
      <li>He who anticipates when the time is right for an idea to come back has the potential to make millions.</li>
      <li>Again, you may not use Computer Architecture <em>directly</em> in your first job; but, developing a sense of the big 
 picture will pay off later in your career.  (Possibly even early in your career.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instruction width:
    <ul>
      <li class="question">Design a machine instruction that does <code>add r1 &lt;= r2 + 6</code></li>
      <li class="question">Which version of <code>add</code> needs more bits?</li>
      <li>Fixed vs. variable width instructions.</li>
      <li class="question">What are the benefits of each?
        <ul>
          <li>fixed:  Simpler hardware =&gt; potentially faster</li>
          <li>variable: more flexible.  Possibly fewer instructions?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">How do you know which one (fixed/variable) is “better”?
        <ul>
          <li>We’ll get back to that.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
