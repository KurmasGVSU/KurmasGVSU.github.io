<P>
<B>Problem</B><BR>

The health insurance available to students at Georgia Tech sucks.
Furthermore, only the Board of Regents, or the state legislature has
the power to fix it.

<P>
<B>Deliverable</B><BR>

A bill requiring the University System of Georgia to provide all GRAs
and GTAs the same level of coverage offered to full-time faculty at
the same price.


<P>
<B>Evaluation</B><BR>

You will receive 1 point for every member of the General Assembly who
votes for your bill.  You will receive full credit if the bill is
signed into law.  No credit will be given if the bill is never brought
up for a vote.
