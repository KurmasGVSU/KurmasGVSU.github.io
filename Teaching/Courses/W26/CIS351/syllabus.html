              <p class='listHeader'><b>Earning an 'A'</b>: Notice that the criteria above are for an <em>A-</em>
                not an <em>A</em>.  To earn a "straight" A, you must meet the criteria for an A- <em>and</em>
                get an 85% or better on the final exam.


                <!----
There is no set criteria for an A. 
In addition to meeting all the criteria for an A- (given in the table above), students who earn an 'A' students must
also demonstrate an exceptional depth of understanding of the course material.
Students may demonstrate this depth of understanding in several  ways including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing unusually insightful answers during class discussion.
<li>Regularly earning Ms or Es on learning objectives the first time they are offered.
<li>Earning many Es on learning objectives, projects, and other assignments.
<li>Adding optional features to projects.
</ul>

                <p><b>+/- modifiers</b>: There will be a comprehensive final exam.  If you score 85% or higher on this exam, you will earn a "+" on your 
                  base grade.  If you score 65% or lower, you will earn a "-".  The final exam has no other effect on your course grade.  I may add a plus or minus to a course grade for other reasons at my discretion.  For example, I reserve the right to add a "-" to your grade for excessive absences.  Note:  GVSU does not award grades of A+ or D-.</p>

                <p><b>Quizzes</b>: There will be an online quiz most weeks over the learning objectives we have covered. Each learning objective will appear on two quizzes. 
                Your grade will be the higher of the two attempts. Unless stated otherwise, quizzes are closed-book, closed-note and will be taken using on Blackboard and/or PrairieLearn 
                using the Respondus Lockdown Broswer. Several quiz topics will require you do draw or annotate a diagram and upload the resulting picture. You will need 
                an appropriate tool for doing so (e.g., a phone with the CamScanner app.)</p>

                <p><b>Exams</b>: There will be three exams and a final exam. Exams will be <em>in person</em> on the dates listed above. There is not a remote option for exams.
                Exams will cover the same learning objectives as quizzes. A successful attempt an exam question will replace a lower grade on a corresponding quiz question.</p>
                
                <p><b>EMPN</b>: Most submissions (other than test/quiz questions and homework) will be scored using the EMPN metric.  (See the 
                  <a href='#empx'>diagram</a> below.)  A mark of "E" or "M" indicates that the submission is complete and clearly demonstrates that the student understands the relevant concepts.  A mark of "P" indicates that the student is making progress, but the assignment require additional work/revision.  A mark of "X" not sufficiently complete to assess.</p>

                <p><b>Projects</b>: There are three main aspects to project submissions:  (1) They must pass the instructor-written automated tests.  (2) They must contain any reqired analysis (e.g., number of gates / running time).  (3) The circuits and other source matrial must be neatly orginzed and commented.  Projects are not evaluated until they pass the automated tests.  Once a student's project passes the automated tests, the instructior will score the presentation and analysis using the EMPX rubric.   Late days will accumulate until the project passes the automated tests and earns a mark of "E" or "M".</p>

                <p><b>Homework</b>: Homework is practice.  As such, it is expected to represent a "best effort" (i.e., be complete and thoughtful).  
                I plan to work through homework problems during online office hours within a day or two of the due date. 
                Therefore, in order to receive credit, students must submit complete and thoughtful solutions by the time solutions are provided.</p>
