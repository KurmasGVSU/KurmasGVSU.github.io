<h2> CIS 351<br>
Using switches with your breadboard</h2>
</center>

You may find it convenient to use switches to control whether an input
wire has a "1" or a "0" on it; however, as you noticed, floating
inputs can cause erratic behavior.  This is because ICs use voltage,
not current, to represent "true" and "false".  To work properly, an
input wire must be clearly connected to +5V (the positive terminal),
or clearly connected to 0V (the negative terminal).  This makes the
use of switches tricky.
<P>
A switch works by connecting and disconnecting wires.  For example, a
traditional wall switch works by connecting two wires that allows
current to flow through a light bulb.  When the wires are connected
allowing current to pass, we say the switch is "closed".  When the
wires are not connected, we say the switch is "open".  Some people
find this counterintuitive.  Just remember that an open switch has an
opening between two wires; therefore, no electricity flows.
Connecting a switch to an IC in the intuitive way doesn't work because
it would create a floating input whenever it was "open".
<P>
This document first describe the two types of switches in your kit,
then explains how to correctly use them with ICs.


<H3> Types of switches </H3>
Your lab kit contains two types of switches: 4-pole DIP switches, and
the round, button-like momentary switches.

<P> DIP switches work just like normal light switches: When a switch
is in the "on" position, there is a path for electricity between the
corresponding pins at the top and bottom of the switch.  Each of the
four switches connects a different pair of pins.

A momentary switch is open by default.  Pressing the button closes the
switch creating a connection over which electricity may flow.  The pin
layout of the momentary switch, however, is not completely obvious.
If you flip the switch over, you will notice that it has four legs:
Two sides have two legs each, and two sides have no legs.  The legs
across from each other on different sides of the switch are always
connected.  Legs next to each other, or diagonally across from each
other are connected only when the switch is depressed.  For the most
part, you need only remember that the pins diagonally across from each
other are affected by the switch.  In fact, you may find that some
switches have only two legs, or that two legs are folded in.

<H3> Using switches</H3>

The correct use of these switches in our labs is not obvious.  Unlike
normal electric wiring, it is not correct to use a switch simply to
open the circuit.  When using logic gates, all inputs must either be
connected to the +5V power supply, or connected to ground.  Failure to
specify an input creates what is known as a "floating input".  The
output of circuits with floating inputs is not defined (i.e., may be
random.)  Using a switch to open a circuit will create a floating
input (as opposed to a logical "false".)  The following diagram shows
how to correctly add a switch to a circuit:
(Note that this shows one switch.  Your blue DIP switch module contains four of these switches.)
<P>

<P> When the switch is open (i.e. the DIP switch is "off", or the
momentary switch is not depressed), there is only a path from A to
ground.  Thus A has a logical value of "false".  When the switch is
closed, then there is also a path from +5v to A.  Because electricity
is lazy, it will choose the path from +5v to A instead of the path
from +5v to ground (thereby avoiding the work to be done in the
resistor).  This gives <CODE>A</CODE> a logical value of "true".  With
your breadbord kits, alwauys use either the  4.7 k&Omega; or 10 k&Omega; resistors with your
switch setups.
<P>
This setup can apply to both the momentary switch and the DIP
switch; however, be sure that each switch has its own resistor.

<!--
<P>

When using the configuration above, having the switch in the "off" position
creates a logical "false".  It is sometimes advantageous to have the
default be a logical "true".  To do this, simply move the
resistors and the output to the other side of the switch as shown
below:
