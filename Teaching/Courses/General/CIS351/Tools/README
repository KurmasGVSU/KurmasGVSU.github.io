JLS.jar is a copy of the most recent JLS.jar.
When a new version comes out, it is necessary
to copy the new version here by hand.

(It would be nice to use a symlink to automate this; 
 but, I use rsync to update the web directory on the 
 server. I have rsync copy simlinks, so only simlinks
 to content within the web site will work.)
