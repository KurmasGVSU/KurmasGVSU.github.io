<p>E-mail is the best way to contact me. During the week, expect a reply within 24 hours. Also, feel free to visit my
    office any time the door is open,
    even if it isn't officially office hours.</p>

<p>For Winter semester, I plan to be downtown in DCIH on Mondays and Wednesdays only. I will be
    in my Allendale office most Tuesdays and some Thursdays. If you already on the Allendale
    campus, feel free to drop by. However, before making a special trip to Allendale,
    I suggest emailing me to make sure I'm available.</p></dd>

    <dt>Course Objectives:<dt>

   <dt>Instruction Format</dt>
   <dd>This course will meet face-to-face as scheduled for lecture. Attendance is <em>required</em>.  
   Many lectures may be "flipped", which means you will
   be expected to have read the assigned material and/or watched the assigned video content before attending lecture.  A few course meetings may be asynchronous.

    <b>Plus/minus modifiers:<b> If you score a 80\% or higher on the comprehensive portion of the final exam,

    <dt>Course Policies:</dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li> I do not re-schedule labs, exams, or quizzes except in
          cases of extreme emergencies. Business trips are not emergencies.
        </li>

        <li> The deadline to drop with a "W" is Friday, 22 March.
          Remember, I cannot and will not drop this class for you.
        </li>

        <LI> Attendance is required. I understand that absences are
          occasionally necessary; however, I reserve the right to lower grades
          for excessive absences.
        </li>

        <li>
          This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at <a href='http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/'><code>http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/</code></a> as well as standard university COVID policies.
        </li>

        <li>You are not <em>under any circumstances</em> allowed to use code that is written by others specifically for you or
        specifically for a CIS 500 assignment. 
        In particular, you may not use code written by ChatGPT or similar software. On homeworks and projects, you may use <em>existing</em> code on sites like Stack Overflow to 
        address a specific, well-defined problem that represents a small portion of the overall assignment. When using code 
        from such resources, you must cite the source.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Special Assistance:</dt>
    <dd>If there is any student in this class who has special needs because of learning, physical or other disability,
      please contact me and Disability Support Services (DSS) at 616.331.2490. Furthermore, if you have a disability and
      think you will need assistance evacuating this classroom and/or building in an emergency situation, please make me
      aware so I can develop a plan to assist you.
    </dd>

  <dt id='learningTargets'>Learning Targets:</dt>
  <dd> Rather than having a small number of "high stakes" exams, we will have weekly quizzes. 
  Each quiz question will evaluate one of the learning targets listed below. Rather than receiving a numerical 
  score, each submission will be scored as either "Success" or "Retry". To demonstrate that you have met a learning target, 
  you must successfully complete quiz questions on that target during <em>two</em> separate weeks. You are not penalized if an attempt is not successful, 
  you simply need to attempt that learning target again on a future quiz. <b>Important:</b> You may only complete four quiz questions in any given week, 
  so plan ahead. (In other words, you can't wait and try to meet all of the learning targets during the last two weeks of class!)</p>

  <p class='listHeader'>The learning targets are divided into two groups: "Programming" and "Other".</p>




  </dd>

  <dt id='projects'>Projects:</dt>
  <dd> There will be four projects. Projects will be scored using the EMPN metric.  (See the 
    <a href='#empn'>diagram</a> below.)  A mark of "E" or "M" indicates that the submission is complete and 
    clearly demonstrates that the student understands the concepts covered by the project. 
     A mark of "P" indicates that the student is making progress, but the project require additional work/revision.  
     A mark of "N" indicates that the project not sufficiently complete to assess. Students are expected to revise and 
     re-submit projects until they have earned an "M" or better.</p>

  <img id="empn" src="EMPNrubric_notYet.png" width=600px>

  <p><b>Late Days:</b> Students will ideally have submitted a project that meets expectations by the stated due date. There is not 
  an explicit penalty if a project still needs revision after the due date; but, I will track the total number of "late days" 
  (days elapsed between the due date and when the student submits a project that meets expectations). Accumulating an excessive number of 
  late days will lower the final grade.</p>

</dd>

  <dt id='grading'>Grading:</dt>
    <dd> Your grade in this course will be <em>specifications-based</em> rather than points/percentage-based. The requirements for 
     grades of A-, B, C, D, and F is given in the table below.  Notice also the special criteria for an A.

<p class='listHeader'><b>Earning an 'A'</b>: Notice that the criteria above are for an <em>A-</em>
not an <em>A</em>.  To earn a "straight" A, you must meet the criteria for an A- <em>and</em> 
get an 85% or better on the final exam.


<!----
There is no set criteria for an A. 
In addition to meeting all the criteria for an A- (given in the table above), students who earn an 'A' students must
also demonstrate an exceptional depth of understanding of the course material.
Students may demonstrate this depth of understanding in several  ways including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing unusually insightful answers during class discussion.
<li>Regularly earning Ms or Es on learning objectives the first time they are offered.
<li>Earning many Es on learning objectives, projects, and other assignments.
<li>Adding optional features to projects.
</ul>

<p><b>+/- modifiers</b>: There will be a comprehensive final exam.  If you score 80% or higher on this exam, you will earn a "+" on your 
base grade.  If you score 60% or lower, you will earn a "-".  The final exam has no other effect on your course grade.  
I may add a plus or minus to a course grade for other reasons at my discretion.  For example, i reserve the right to add a "-" to your grade for excessive absences.  Note:  GVSU does not award grades of A+ or D-.</p>
