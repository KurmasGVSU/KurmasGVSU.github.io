<h3>Pre-lab</h3>

Please have questions 1 - 5 answered when you arrive in lab.

<h3> Overview</h3>

<p>
   The purpose of this lab is to become more familiar with the concept of pipelining,
   as found in modern CPU architectures. Specifically,
   the lab involves the use of a graphical pipeline simulator. This
   tool will be used to further your understanding of how a pipeline works,
   how it is implemented, and how it deals with the problems introduced by
   using this high-performance technique.</p>

<h3 class="listHeader"> Activities</h3>
<ul>
   <li> Work your way through the following brief tutorial.</li>
   <li> Submit a lab report that includes answers to the numbered
      questions and your annotated source code.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="listHeader"> Resources</h3>
<ul>
   <li> There is an on-line <a href="dlxview/help.html">User Manual</a>
      available for the visualization tool used in this lab.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3> A graphical pipeline simulator</h3> The name of this simulation
tool is <code>DLXview</code>. Its purpose is to graphically illustrate the
operation of the pipeline implemented in the DLX architecture.
DLX is the name Patterson and Hennessy gave to the hypothetical
machine and instruction set we have been studying. (Although, I don't
think they use the DLX name in the current edition of the
textbook.)<br>


<h3> Operating DLXview</h3>
To start DLXview, simply type <b><code>dlxview</code></b> at the command
prompt.
<dl>
   <dt>Configuring the system</dt>

   <dd>The first step is to configure the machine to simulate a specific
      pipelined architecture. Feel free to experiment with alternative
      configurations. However, this lab utilizes only the default mode
      with default parameters. See the user manual for a description of
      the various configuration parameters available.
      <ul>
         <li> Click the <b><code>configure</code></b> button. A pop-up window
            will present a set of scheduling modes.
         </li>
         <li> Select <b><code>basic pipeline</code></b>.
            A pop-up window will present a set of configuration parameters
            appropriate for the pipeline mode you have selected.
         </li>
         <li> Accept the <b><code>default</code></b> configuration by clicking <b><code>OK</code></b>.</li>
         <li> Again, click <b><code>OK</code></b>.</li>
      </ul>
   </dd>

   <dt>Loading an executable</dt>
   <dd>
      Once the system has been configured, a file can be loaded for
      execution.
      <ul>
         <li> Download the assembly program file <a href="exampleDLX-1.s"><code>exampleDLX-1.s</code></a>
            into your current directory.
         </li>
         <li> Click the <b><code>load</code></b> button.&nbsp; A file selection
            window will pop up.
         </li>
         <li> Select the file (<code>exampleDLX-1.s</code>) by clicking on it.</li>
         <li> Click <code><b>load</b>.</code></li>
         <li> Click <b><code>done</code></b>.</li>
      </ul>
   </dd>

   <dt>Running a program</dt>
   <dd>
      To execute a program:
      <ul>
         <li> Click the <b><code>step forward</code></b> button to begin
            execution.; A pop-up window will request a starting address.
         </li>
         <li> Click the <b><code>default</code></b> button.</li>
         <li> Click the <b><code>step forward</code></b> button or the <b><code>next
            cycle</code></b> button to progress through the assembly program. <span
               style="font-style: italic;">Stepping </span>advances execution
            forward to the next instruction. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cycling</span>
            advances the simulation by one clock cycle. These are usually, but
            not always, the same thing (i.e., most instructions take a single
            cycle). The <b><code>step back</code></b> and <b><code>previous cycle</code></b>
            buttons will also be very helpful in observing and understanding
            pipeline operation.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
         <li> How many cycles does it take to fill the pipeline? (Notice that
            DLXview labels the cycles beginning with zero. To avoid ambiguity,
            fill in the blank: "In DLXview, the first cycle during which all the
            pipeline stages are busy is labeled _____.")
         </li>

         <li> How many cycles does it take for the computer to execute the
            first instruction completely?
         </li>

         <li> What pipeline stage is the instruction <code>and r6, r7,
            r8</code> in during cycle number 5 (i.e., the cycle labeled 5)?
         </li>

         <li> During which cycle does the the processor begin computing the
            instruction <code>and r12, r13, r14</code>? (Make sure your answer clearly states "the <code>x</code>th
            cycle" or
            "the cycle labeled x").
         </li>

         <li> During which cycle does the the processor finish computing the
            instruction <code>and r12, r13, r14</code>? (Make sure your answer clearly states "the <code>x</code>th
            cycle" or
            "the cycle labeled x").
         </li>
      </ol>
   </dd>

   <dt>Views</dt>
   <dd>
      The top half of the display window is an instruction timing diagram,
      calibrated in clock cycles. Each instruction is uniquely colored
      to make it easier to follow its progress through the pipeline. In
      addition to the timing diagram, DLXview provides two views of the
      pipeline in operation. The button near the bottom of the screen
      allows you to toggle between the two viewing modes.
      <ul>
         <li> the <b><code>block diagram</code></b> shows the entire pipeline as
            labeled stages
         </li>
         <li> the <b><code>integer datapath</code></b> presents a detailed
            device-level view of the pipeline
         </li>
      </ul>
   </dd>
</dl>

<h3> The DLXview implementation of the DLX architecture</h3>

DLXview
is a fairly straightforward implementation of the DLX
architecture. Recall the differences between a pipelined
processor and the simpler processor we described in class:
<ul>
   <li> Pipeline latches have been added between datapath stages, and
      named appropriately. Think of them as "holding" the results of the
      previous stage of the pipeline (left) and forwarding those results on to
      the next stage of the pipeline (right).
   </li>
   <li> Additional wiring has been added to efficiently distribute
      results. For example, multiple transfer wires emanate from the
      Write Back stage and serve as input (feedback) to previous stages of the
      pipeline. This loop back technique is known as <span
            style="font-style: italic;">data forwarding</span> and is used to solve
      some of the timing problems associated with pipeline hazards.
   </li>
   <li> Branches are resolved in the Instruction Decode stage.
      Hence the necessary logic has been moved into that stage of the pipeline.
   </li>
</ul>


<h3> A simple pipelined program</h3>

<p>The assembly program loaded earlier (<code>exampleDLX-1.s</code>) is a very simple
   program with no data dependencies, branches, or other potential
   problems. The code is well-documented and should be easily
   understood. Take some time now to execute the program,
   familiarizing yourself with the different views and the operation of the
   simulator.</p>


<p>Pay particular attention to the register file. Notice how it
   indicates which registers are being read from and written to.
   Also pay close attention to the muxes. They help indicate which
   of the many values generated in the previous stage are actually being
   used in the current stage. (In other words, watching the lines
   through the muxes shows you where the inputs to the ALU are coming
   from.) Stepping backward and forward will help you understand how an
   individual instruction progresses through the pipeline. </p>

<p>Note: we are only concerned here with the operation and control of
   the pipeline. In other words, we don't care what data values are
   actually in the registers or what the results of the operations
   are. It is possible, however, to initialize registers to a desired
   value using a <code>*.i</code> file. See the User's manual for additional
   information. </p>

<p>Note: it is possible at any time to change the operation of the
   simulator by editing the source code (see the file selection window). </p>

<p>Let's trace through the execution of a single instruction. The
   first instruction in the example program loads a word from memory into a
   register. Recall that DLX data addressing uses the indexed
   method. The word to be read from memory is located at the address
   contained in the instruction itself (i.e. the constant value 0), offset
   (or indexed) by the value contained in register R2. The word read
   from memory is to be loaded into register R1. </p>
<ul>
   <li> In the first phase of the instruction cycle, the instruction is
      fetched (note the color: it's the yucky brown instruction in the
      pipeline).
   </li>
   <li> In the second phase, the instruction is decoded (although this is
      not illustrated, the opcode is being used to specify a <b><code>load</code></b>
      operation). In addition, any necessary values are read from the
      register file. In this case, the value of register R2 is read
      because it is needed for subsequent memory addressing. The
      simulator indicates the register <b><code>read</code></b> by displaying a
      colored R2 in the box representing the register file.
   </li>
   <li> After executing the third cycle, the effective address of the
      operand has been calculated. Note the paths drawn through the two
      muxes in the Execute stage. Tracing back the path in the upper mux
      indicates a value originating in the register file -- this represents
      the contents of R2. The path through the lower mux traces back to
      the sign-extended immediate operand datapath -- this represents the
      constant 0 from the instruction.
   </li>
   <li> In the fourth cycle the memory word is read. This is not
      really evident until the next phase.
   </li>
   <li> The last stage is the Write Back phase. This stage always
      uses a value generated in the previous stage. In this case, the
      instruction was a load from memory into a register. Examining the
      register file shows that data is being written to register R1. (Values
      displayed near the top of the register file are <b><code>read</code></b>
      values, the value displayed near the bottom represents a <b><code>write</code></b>
      operation). Tracing back the wire representing the register file
      write operation reveals the origin of the value being written -- the
      data memory.
   </li>
</ul>
Trace through the execution of the other instructions in the program
until you are confident you understand the operation of the pipeline.
<ol start=6>
   <li> Which registers are being read during cycle 5 (the cycle labeled 5)?</li>
   <li> Which registers are being written during cycle 5 (the cycle labeled 5)?</li>
   <li> Where does input to the main ALU come from during cycle 2 (the cycle labeled 2)?</li>
   <li> Where does input to the main ALU come from during cycle 3 (the cycle labeled 3)?</li>
   <li> What is the purpose of all of the <code style="font-weight: bold;">nops</code>
      at the end of the sample program?
   </li>
</ol>

<h3> Structural hazards</h3>

<p>A structural hazard is another term for a resource conflict.
   Resource conflicts (we will discuss this in more detail in class) refer
   to contention for a specific functional unit. Take a moment to
   study the integer data path of the DLX pipeline.</p>

<p>It is possible that the Instruction Fetch stage might be accessing
   memory at the same time as the Memory Access stage. One
   stage is reading an instruction and the other is reading a data
   value. Only one word can be read from a memory unit at time.
   This is an example of a resource conflict. </p>

<ol start="11">
   <li> How does the DLX pipeline architecture resolve this conflict?</li>
</ol>

Locate the adder in the Instruction Decode stage. Trace its
backward and forward connections to understand its operation well enough
to answer the question:
<ol start="12">
   <li> What purpose does this adder serve?</li>
</ol>

<h3> Data hazards</h3>
The next type of hazard is a data hazard, which always involves some
type of data dependency. In a typical instance, the current
instruction requires some operand that is being generated by the
preceding instruction (e.g. a <b><code>load</code></b> or an <b><code>ALU</code></b>
operation). Program <a href="exampleDLX-2.s">exampleDLX-2.s</a>
contains such a dependency. Download the program and study the
code. Load and run the program and study its execution.

<ol start="13">

   <li> Identify all pairs of instructions that have a data dependency.
      In particular identify all pairs of instructions (not necessarily
      adjacent) where the result of the second instruction depends
      directly on the result of the first.
   </li>


   <li> Describe in your own words how the DLX hardware addresses this
      dependency problem. Your answer should be precise enough to
      convince me that you understand the mechanism used.
   </li>

   <li> Trace through the progress of the fourth instruction in a
      manner similar to that used in the section above ("<b>A simple
         pipelined program</b>"). There is a "visual bug" or discrepancy that
      you will notice as you trace through the execution of this
      program. Identify it.
   </li>


   <LI> Step to cycle 4. Use your favorite screenshot tool
      to capture the main DLXview window. Print the snapshot and highlight
      the set of wires that shows how the result of <code>sub r3, r4,
         r5</code> is routed directly to the main ALU.

</ol>

Some data dependencies span several instructions. Program <a
      href="exampleDLX-3.s">exampleDLX-3.s</a> demonstrates this problem in
cycle 5, when the first <code>add</code> instruction is writing
register <code>r3</code> during the same cycle that the second
<code>add</code> instruction is reading <code>r3</code>.

<P>
<OL start=17>

   <li> Which value of <code>r3</code> will be read if the DLX
      processor used the register file provided for Project 4? If the
      wrong value would be read, describe how you would properly
      coordinate the reading and writing of the registers.
   </li>

</ol>


<p>Not all data dependencies can be solved by forwarding. Program
   <a href="exampleDLX-4.s">exampleDLX-4.s</a> contains an example of a type
   of hazard that forwarding cannot eliminate. Download the
   program and study the code. Load and run the program and study
   its execution.</p>


<p>Examine all of the instructions in the example program and identify
   their dependencies. Notice that the <b><code>add</code></b>
   instruction immediately follows a <b><code>load</code></b>
   instruction. This is an example of a dependency immune to
   forwarding. Execute the program using <i>cycles</i> instead of
   stepping. Refer to the timing diagram and notice the presence
   of stalls in the pipeline. A <i>stall</i> is a delay cycle, or
   bubble, inserted into the pipeline. When this type of data
   dependency (called a load data hazard) is detected, hardware
   known as a <b><code>load interlock</code><span style="font-family:
 monospace;"></span></b> will delay subsequent instructions to resolve
   the timing problem. Study the operation of this program until
   you understand both the problem and the solution. </p>


<ol start="18">

   <li> Why must the <b><code>add</code></b> operation be delayed one
      cycle? Your answer should consider timing issues and functional
      units. Be sure to explain why forwarding cannot solve the
      problem.
   </li>


   <li> Describe how hardware can <i>detect</i> a load data hazard.</li>
</ol>


<h3> Control hazards</h3>

<p>The final type of hazard involves control transfer -- branches and
   jumps. Program <a href="exampleDLX-5.s">exampleDLX-5.s</a>
   implements control transfer in the form of a loop. Download,
   study, and execute the code until you understand its operation.
   The comments in the code should help you understand what the loop is
   doing.</p>

<p>

   The DLX hardware resolves branches in the Instruction Decode stage of
   the pipeline. Instead of a <code>beq</code> instruction that uses
   subtraction in the ALU to compare two registers, the DLX hardware has
   <code>bez</code> and <code>bnz</code> instructions that branch if the
   specified register is equal or not equal to 0 respectively. These
   new branch instructions allow the hardware to determine by the end of
   the second cycle whether to take the branch. </p>

<p>
   Notice that the instruction immediately following the branch
   instruction is a <code>nop</code>. This
   <code>nop</code> is called a <i>branch delay slot</i> and is
   typically inserted by the compiler.
</p>

<ol start="20">
   <li> Why is the branch delay slot necessary? In other words, what
      would go wrong if we removed the <code>nop</code>?
   </li>

   <li> Suppose you had a smarter compiler. Explain what it could put in the branch delay slot instead of a
      <code>nop</code>.
   </li>

   <!---
      </li> <ul> <li> Remember:
    compilers only deal with code &mdash; no hardware solutions allowed.</li>
    <li> Also remember: compilers are not omniscient. Top credit
    will be given for solutions that <span style="font-style:
    italic;">rearrange or reorder</span> existing code, rather than
    rewrite code. (This means no loop unrolling &mdash; yet.)</li> </ul>
   -->

   <li> Write an optimized assembly program incorporating your code
      adjustments. Your solution must still contain a loop.
   </li>

   <li> How many cycles does the original program take to assign the
      final result to register R6? (In other words, during which cycle
      is the instruction <code>add r6, r4, r5</code> in the "write-back"
      phase?)
   </li>

   <li> How many cycles does your optimized assembly program take to do
      the same work?
   </li>
</ol>
