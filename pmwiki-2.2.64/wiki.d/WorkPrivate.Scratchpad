text=[++Brief Summary of Project++]%0a%0aI am seeking funding to add a second phase to my very successful JLSCircuitTester project (which was generously funded by FTLC in Summer 2008).%0a%0aJLSCircuitTester is a computer program that helps instructors and students verify that their Computer Architecture (CS 451 at GVSU) projects are correct. JLSCircuitTester has significantly improved learning in my CS 451 classroom.  As explained fully in our ITiCSE paper \cite{kurmas08}, JLSCircuitTester simplifies the testing process to the point where students are willing to thoroughly test their CS 451 projects before submitting them.  As a result, my students are now taking the time to find and fix problems in their projects.  In doing so, they also fix the misconception that caused the problem.  Prior to JLSCircuitTester many students wouldn't know they had misunderstood  or misapplied something until I returned their graded assignments (by which time the class had moved onto other topics and the misconceptions never got fixed).  JLSCircuitTester also greatly reduces the time needed to grade these projects, thereby freeing up time for me to improve the course in other ways (better lectures, homework problems, etc).  My students this past Fall did better than any of my previous CS 451 sections.  I am confident that JLSCircuitTester played a non-trivial role in their success.%0a%0aIn spite of its wild success in my classroom, JLSCircuitTester has not been adopted as widely outside GVSU as I had hoped.  It's main limitation is that it works only with the JLS Digital Logic Simulator (a separate computer program written by a colleague at Michigan Tech).  JLS has not been adopted as widely as I had expected.   (The author of JLS, David Poplawski, has moved into an administrative role and hasn't had much time to improve and promote it.)  My goal is to extend JLSCircuitTester to work with other digital logic simulators, thus making it easier for more professors to integrate into their classrooms.%0a %0aIn addition, over the past several semesters, my students have made several excellent suggestions for improvement.  While extending JLSCircuitTester, I would like to make some of their suggested improvements.%0a%0aMy plan for this summer is to make some suggested improvements to JLSCircuitTester, then add code  that will allow it to work with as many other digital logic simulators as possible, including TKGate,  DLSim3, ..., and .... After I have added support for several simulators, I would like to take the core of JLSCircuitTester and package it in a way that instructors can easily extend it themselves to work with any digital logic simulator.%0a%0aI am seeking funding to work on JLSCIrcuitTesteri in lieu of teaching a summer course.  I have been doing traditional research as my area of significant focus, therefore, time to work on JLSCircuitTester (which at this point is primarily a teaching resource) has been limited.  This FTLC grant will provide me time to continue this work.%0aThis project can be easily and productively scaled according to available funding.  I will add support for as many different digital logic simulators as funding allows.  The most simulators I can support, the more use JLSCircuitTester will get outside of GVSU.%0a%0aI plan to present my updated and expanded JLSCircuitTester at the Workshop for Computer Architecture Education.  I have previously presented the program at SIGCSE and ITiCSE (the top two conferences in computer science education); however, the Workshop for Computer Architecture Education specifically targets instructors for whom JLSCircuitTester would be useful.%0a%0a[++Program Objectives++]%0a%0aMy primary objective is to make the improvements to JLSCircuitTester that will make instructors outside of GVSU more likely to use it in their classroom.  I want all students, not just GVSU students to have the opportunity of benefiting from JLSCircuitTester. Primarily, I need to add code to JLSCircuitTester so that it will work with the digital logic simulator they are already using.  (Currently, instructors who wish to use JLSCircuitTester must adopt JLS as their digital logic simulator).%0a%0aMaking the changes suggested by our students will make the tool easier for them to use.  The benefits of these improvements are mostly indirect (lower cognitive load, higher satisfaction with the course).%0a%0aThis summer's project (adding code for specific digital logic simulators) is the first step toward a larger goal of packaging the core JLSCircuitTester so that it can be easily extended by instructors to work with the digital logic simulator of their choice.  (Writing specific extensions will highlight commonalities that I can leverage and pitfalls I must avoid when designing a package that can potentially interact with any digital logic simulator.)%0a%0a+Problem definition+ %0a%0aI first describe the problem that JLSCircuitTester solved, then discuss the issues that this phase of the project will specifically address.%0a%0a++%0a%0aEvaluation would be # of downloads and/or adoption rate over two year period.%0a%0a----%0a%0aKurt%0a%0aIn your opinion, does the following have the potential to become a competitive Pew Scholar Teacher Grant application for this summer?  I know there are a lot of details missing, but I wanted to make sure there weren't any obvious deal breakers before investing a lot of time in the formal writeup.%0a%0aIn 2008, I received a Pew Scholar Teacher grant to build a computer program called JLSCircuitTester.   That project has been wildly successful: I had a publication accepted at ITiCSE (one of the top two CS education conferences) and my computer architecture students are consistently turning in higher quality projects as a result.%0a%0aHowever, I have not been as successful as I had hoped getting other instructors to use the program.  The problem is that my program works only with a specific digital logic simulator called JLS.  Instructors who want to use JLSCircuitTester must also use JLS.  To make my program more attractive to instructors outside GVSU, I want to add code that will allow JLSCircuitTester to work with other popular digital logic simulators.  (What I propose is analogous to adding code to Microsoft Word's grammar check so that it will also work with other word processors.)%0a%0aThe benefits of this project would be %0a* Making the benefits of JLSCircuitTester available to computer architecture students outside GVSU%0a* Promoting GVSU (It makes us look good to have other universities using our products)%0a%0aI initially designed JLSCircuitTester so that the main code was separate from the code that interacts with the digital logic simulator.  Therefore, this summer's project would be to add code to JLSCircuitTester, not to completely re-write it.%0a%0aI would be doing this project in lieu of teaching a summer class.%0a%0aMy primary publication target for this project would be the Workshop on Computer Architecture Education.  This workshop is targeted to instructors who could potentially use JLSCircuitTester.  In contrast, my previous publications were at conferences targeting a general Computer Science education audience.%0a%0aAlso feel free to share any suggestions or concerns.%0a%0aThank you for your time,%0a%0aZack%0a%0a
