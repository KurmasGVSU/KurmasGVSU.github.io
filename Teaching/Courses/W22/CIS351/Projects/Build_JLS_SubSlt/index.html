<p class="listHeader">
  Extend your signed adder from the previous project to build</p>
<ul>
  <li>a circuit than can both add and subtract, and</li>
  <li>a circuit that can compare signed and unsigned integers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class='listHeader'>Setup</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Follow <a href='https://classroom.github.com/a/WM-rb-E4'>this GitHub Classroom link</a> to create a repository for the project.</li>
  <li>Copy your adder from Project 1 into this new repo.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Task 1: Adder/Subtractor</h2>


<p>Build a circuit that can do both addition and subtraction. Specifically, surround your adder with 
   additional gates so that it performs both addition and subtraction. This circuit should contain <em>one</em> adder only. 
   Be sure to ask for clarification if you don't understand this requirement. </p>

<p>Place your Adder/Subtractor in <code>SignedAddSubtract_16bit.jls</code>. 
 Do not change the names of the input or output pins.</p>

<p>The <code>Op</code> input specifies whether to perform addition or subtraction.
  (<code>1</code> means subtract, <code>0</code> means add).</p>

<p>The  <code>CarryOut</code> and <code>Overflow</code> outputs should simply be the carry out and overflow from your 
  adder. Unsigned subtraction cannot overflow. Unsigned subtraction that generates a negative result is not considered
  "overflow".</p>

<p>You may use <code>SampleSigned16BitAddSubtractTest.java</code> as a
  basis for your own tests. <b>Warning!</b> This test class is incomplete. Don't assume that a circuit that
  passes this sample test will pass all of my tests.

<h2>Task 2: Set if Less Than</h2>

<p>Build a circuit that can compare two integers.  It must support both signed and unsigned comparisons.</p>

<p class="listHeader">Use your adder/subtractor as a starting point and leverage the fact that</p>

<ul>
  <li>if <code>A &lt; B</code>, then <code>A - B &lt; 0</code>, and</li>
  <li>if <code>A &ge; B</code>, then <code>A - B &ge; 0</code>.
</ul>

<p>Be aware, however, that this algorithm works only as long as <code>A - B</code> doesn't overflow. You'll need to
  think about the conditions under which <code>A - B</code> might overflow and use alternate techniques for comparing
  <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> in this case.  (Hint:  Don't try to detect and react to overflow.  That doesn't 
  tend to work well.  Instead, think about the conditions under which you might have an overflow.)</p>

<p>Place your comparison circuit in <code>Slt_16bit.jls</code>. 
 Do not change the names of the input or output pins.</p>

<p>You may use <code>SampleSlt16BitTest.java</code> as a
  basis for your own tests. <b>Warning!</b> This test script is incomplete. Don't assume that a circuit that
  passes this sample test will pass all of my tests.


<h2 class="listHeader">Rules</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work in groups of <b>two</b>. You may work alone only <em>with permission of the
    instructor</em>.
  </li>

  <li>The simulator comes with a built-in adder. You may <em>not</em> use
    the built-in adder.
  </li>

  <li>To build the required circuits, you will probably find it useful to
    design and build several subcircuits. These subcircuits may have any
    interface you choose; however, you are responsible for testing them.
  </li>

  <li>You must write all of your own chips. In other words, you may not
    share "internal" chips with your classmates, or download them off the
    Internet.
  </li>

  <li>Be sure to test your components thoroughly. Just because it passes
    the test included here doesn't mean it will pass <em>my</em> test.
  </li>

  <li>You may use the built-in mux component.</li>
</ol>


<h2 class="listHeader">Hints and shortcuts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Remember, JLS inserts the code for sub-circuits directly into the
    circuits into which they are imported. Thus, changes to sub-circuits
    are not seen by the circuits that contain them. If you discover a bug
    in a sub-circuit, you must delete and re-import that sub-circuit into
    the parent. (Again, test your subcircuits thoroughly before importing
    them!)
  </li>

  <li>Remember that no software is perfect. This includes <code>JLS</code>
    and <code>DLUnit</code>. Commit and push your circuits often.
  </li>

  <li>Remember to test your circuits thoroughly. 
  My sample test file will not catch several common mistakes.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="Grading">Grading</a></h2>

<p> <span class='inline-important'>You are expected to revise your circuits until 
<em>both</em> (1) the automated tests pass, <em>and</em> (2) your circuit design and layout have earned a score of "E" or "M".</span> 
Project "Late Days" will accumulate until both requirements have been satisfied.  Remember:  There are two separate sets of tests to run.

<p>You can accumulate up to -1 Late Days if you project meets all requirements before the deadline. 
 (Negative Late Days can be used to offset any Late Days acquired on other projects or labs.)

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p class="listHeader">To submit your project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add a text box to your <code>jls</code> files that includes the names of everybody on the team.
  </li>
   <li>Commit and push your code.</li>
   <li>When your code passes all my tests, add <code>[Grade Me]</code> to the commit message.</li>
    </ul>

</ol>
