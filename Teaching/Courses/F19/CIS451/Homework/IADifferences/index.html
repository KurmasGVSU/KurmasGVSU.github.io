  <p><b>Warning:</b>This assignment is designed to be completed in-class.  There are details missing that you will need
  to talk to me about if you are attempting to make this assignment up.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this lab is to explore the different behaviors of
    different CPUs that implement the Intel instruction set. To put it
    another way, we want to observe an AMD processor behaving differently
    from an Intel processor --- especially with respect to the implementation of their superpipelines.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>This lab will use a lot of Intel assembly language as well as many
    different UNIX tools. Before you begin, you may want to review the Intel
    Assembly Overview from the Intel Machine Language assignment, as well as the following UNIX topics:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>C programming</li>
    <li>Bash scripts</li>
    <li>pipes</li>
    <li>perl</li>
    <li>gnuplot</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Determining the pipeline width</h2>

  <p>At a high level, we are going to determine the number of cycles it takes to execute <code>n</code> instructions.
    This will give us a rough estimate of the number of instructions executed per cycle (IPC). For example, if the
    CPU can execute 1000 instructions in 500 cycles, then we know that, on average, it is completing 2 instructions
    per cycle.
  </p>

  <h3>Timing Code with <code>rdtsc</code></h3>

  <p> All x86 processors have a register called the <em>time stamp counter</em>. The CPU sets this register to 0 when it
    boots up and increments it every time the clock ticks. You can use this register to time code: Simply use the
    <code>rdtsc</code> assembly instruction to read the timestamp counter immediately before and after the code you
    are timing.</p>

  <p>For this lab, we will be timing code that looks something like this:</p>
  <pre>
    rdtsc            # read the starting cycle count (rdtsc puts its answer in %edx and %eax)
    push %eax        # save the timestamp on the stack so it doesn't get clobbered by the next call to rdtsc
    addl $1, %ecx
    addl $1, %ecx
    ...              # repeat this instruction many times.
    addl $1, %ecx
    addl $1, %ecx
    rdtsc            # read the ending cycle count
    pop %ebx         # retrieve the starting cycle count
    subl %ebx, %eax  # Compute the elapsed number of cycles (subtract the starting value, %ebx, from the ending value)
    </pre>

  <p class="listHeader">In theory, the difference in the values returned by the two calls to <code>rdtsc</code> is the
    number of cycles required to run the <code>n</code> intervening instructions. (This isn't completely true for
    reasons that will be discussed later; but, it is good enough for right now.)</p>

  <h3>Collecting Evidence</h3>

  <p>There is a fair amount of noise in the measurement of the assembly code shown above:
    The superscalar processor will likely schedule the <code>rdtsc</code> instructions in parallel with other nearby
    instructions. Therefore, we cannot be sure we are timing precisely <code>n</code> instructions. To compensate for
    this uncertainty, we will take many measurements with increasing values of <code>n</code>. The overall trend will
    give us a clearer picture of the superpipeline's width than the measurement for a single <code>n</code>. </p>

  <p>The code to be measured will not contain a loop: Instead of looping over a body of <code>n</code> instructions, we
    will "hand write" a sequence of <code>n</code> instructions. We avoid using a loop because the loop structure would
    add extra instructions with different dependencies. To avoid loops, we write a different function for each value of
    <code>n</code> we wish to test. The Ruby script <a
    href="generate_experiments3.rb"><code>generate_experiments3.rb</code></a> automates this process.

  <p class="listHeader">Run <code>generate_experiments3.rb</code>. Examine the resulting output. Notice</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The function <code>step_group</code> contains the sequence of instructions to be repeated and timed.</li>
    <li>The functions <code>time_xx_ops</code> contain the code to time a sequence of the desired length.
      Notice that this function:
      <ul>
        <li>follows conventional stack frame set-up/tear-down (whereas
          <code>step_group</code> does not,
        </li>
        <li>calls <code>step_group</code> enough times to generate a sequence of the desired length, and</li>
        <li>contains the calls to <code>rdtsc</code> that time the sequence of operations.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The output from <code>generate_experiments3.rb</code> contains only the code being timed.
    <a href='time_instructions2.c'><code>time_instructions2.c</code></a> contains <code>main</code> as well as a loop that calls the functions to be
    tested and prints the results.</p>


  <h3>Comparing CPUs and interpreting the results</h3>

  This semester, we have three CPUs available for experimentation:

  <ul>
    <li>The Intel i7s in EOS</li>
    <li>The Intel i5s in Data Com</li>
    <li>The AMDs in Arch</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="listHeader">Begin by timing a sequence of <code>addl</code> instructions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Run <code>generate_experiments3.rb</code> and redirect the output to a file (I'll call it
      <code>asm1.s</code></li>
    <li>Examine <code>asm1.s</code> and make sure you undertand what it's doing.</li>
    <li>Compile <code>asm1.s</code> and <code><a href='time_instructions2.c'><code>time_instructions2.c</code></a></code> together into a single
      executable and run it.</li>

    <li>You will notice that the CPI for the initial workload is less than 1.  Have me explain why, then adjust
      <code>time_instructions</code> to account for the problem.</li>


    <li>Run the previous test on the different CPUs
      and plot the results together on the same graph. Attach a copy
      of your plot to your lab report. If using <code>gnuplot</code>,
      you can change your output format and save the plot to a
      file. First type
      "<code>set&nbsp;term&nbsp;<em>mode</em></code>", where
      <em>mode</em> is one of many output formats, including
      "postscript", "jpeg", "png", and "pbm". (Type <code>help
      term</code> for the complete list.) After you have set the term,
      type "<code>set&nbsp;output&nbsp;<em>filename</em></code>".
      Typing "<code>set&nbsp;term&nbsp;x11</code>" will return the
      output to the screen. WARNING: <code>gnuplot</code> doesn't
      always correctly overwrite files. So, make sure your plots look
      good on the screen <em>before</em> changing the terminal and
      output file.  <!--HINT: Entering the line <code>set sytle data
      linespoints</code> will plot all data files using the
      "linespoints" style.  The <code>linespoints</code> style is
      generally easier to read than a bunch of isolated points.--></li>

    <li>Find the approximate slope of each line.</li>

    <li>Describe the differences you see between CPUs (if any).</li>

    <li>Now, edit <code>generate_experiments3.rb</code> so that instead of timing a sequence of <code>addl $1,
      %eax</code>, it times a sequence of <code>addl $1, %eax; addl $1, %ecx</code>.  (Look for where
      <code>instruction_pool</code> is defined near line 154.)
      Run it on the different hardware. What are the slopes of the lines?
    </li>

    <li>The slopes of the line should be significantly less than 1. What
      does this tell you?
    </li>

    <li>The first test produces code that looks like this:
      <pre>
		addl $1, %eax
		addl $1, %eax
		addl $1, %eax
		addl $1, %eax
		...
		</pre>
      whereas the second  produces code that looks like
      this:
      <pre>
		addl $1, %eax
		addl $1, %ecx
		addl $1, %eax
		addl $1, %ecx
		...
		</pre>
      Why can the CPU run the second example faster?
    </li>

    <li>Figure out how many <code>add</code> instructions each different
      CPU can do in parallel. Attach graphs demonstrating this. (In other
      words, show me how you figured it out.) In general, each plot should contain more than one line.
      Look most
      closely at the slope of the line in the range <code>[10000, 15000]</code> (If you don't see at least one CPU
      that can handle more than 2 instructions at a time, let me know.) <b>WARNING:</b> Make sure your timing code
      doesn't use <code>%ebx</code>, <code>%r13d</code>, or any other register that is in use <em>at the point your
      code being time is being run.</em>
    </li>

    <li>The i7 can, in theory, complete 4 instructions in parallel.  Try to find a sequence of four instructions
      that the i7 will issue and execute in parallel.</li>

    <!--
    <li>Thus far, we have been testing an <code>add</code> instruction with
       an immediate parameter. Now, try an <code>add</code> instruction that
       takes two register-direct parameters (e.g., <code>addl %eax, %ebx</code>).
       How many can run in parallel?


    <li>Now, find out how many register-indirect instructions (e.g., <code>addl
       -4(%rbp), %eax</code>) can run in parallel?
        -->
  </ol>

  <!--
  <h2>Timing <code>imull</code></h2>

  <p>Now, let's look at how the compiler handles multiplication:</p>

  <p>Write some C code that includes the line <code>x *= 7</code> where <code>x</code> is declared to be a
     <code>register int</code>.</p>

  <ol start="15">
     <li>What assembly code is generated for this line? (It should be several lines.)</li>
     <li>Explain how this assembly code works.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Now find a constant value that causes the compiler to generate an <code>imull</code> instruction. Time a single
     <code>mull</code> instruction the same
     manner you tested timed the <code>add</code>.

  <ol start="17">

     <li>Find the slope of the lines for each CPU.</li>
     <li>What do these graphs tell you about time it takes to perform a multiply?<?li>

     <li>Now repeat the experiment for larger groups of multiplies and find out how many multiplies can be executed in
        parallel.
     </li>
  </ol>
