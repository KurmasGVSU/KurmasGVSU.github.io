   <span>Digital Logic Homework</span></h1>

<ol>

<li> (Harris & Harris exercise 2.24) Write Boolean equations for the circuit shown below.  You need not minimize the
   equations. <br>

<img src="hh_fig_2_81.jpg" width="400"></li>

   <li> Picture a typical 7-line LED display (e.g., one digit of a
      typical digital alarm clock --- see the diagram below). You are
      going to design a combinatorial circuit that controls whether
      the bottom-left LED is
      lit (LED z_<sub>5</sub> to be precise). LED z_<sub>5</sub> is
      lit for numbers 0, 2, 6, and 8; and blank for all
      other inputs --- including invalid inputs.

      <ol type="A">
         <li> Write the truth table for this circuit. (The circuit is
         for LED z_<sub>5</sub> only. Do not include columns for
            other LEDs.)
         </li>
         <li> Express the truth table in Sum-of-Products form.</li>
	 <li> Draw the logic diagram for this combinatorial circuit in a "PLA-style".</li>
      </ol>
   </li>

   <li> Draw the logic diagram corresponding to this boolean expression: <code>(AB xor <span class="over">(B + <span
         class="over">C&#x305;</span>)</span>) + A&#x305;C</code>. (THe bar should be over the first "C" and the last
      "A".) You may use XOR gate. (Notice the bar above the <code>C</code>.)
   </li>

      <li> Draw the logic diagram corresponding to this boolean
   expression: <code>XZ + (XY + Z&#x305;)</code>  (The bar should be over the last "Z".)
   </li>


   <li> Draw a logic diagram to show how to build an exclusive-or gate out
      of AND, OR, and NOT gates.
   </li>

   <li> Show how to build a NAND gate using only NOR gates. Hint: Use
      <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_4/chpt_7/8.html">De
         Morgan's Theorems</a>. <!-- You will find a brief discussion in the "In
  More Depth" section of your book's companion CD. --> You can also use
      <a target="_top" href="http://www.google.com">google</a> to find
      more extensive discussions <a
            href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_4/chpt_7/8.html">on the
         web</a>.
   </li>

   <li> Show that {NOR} is logically complete. Your "proof" must
      include sentences. Diagrams alone are not sufficient.
   </li>

   <li>Using the relay shown below as a model, show how you could
      combine one or more relays to build a NAND gate. (Relays are
      covered by <a target="_top"

   <li> Show how you could construct an OR gate using transistors.

   <li> (<em>From Null 3rd ed., Chapter 3, number 35</em>.) Construct a truth table to describe the operation of this
      circuit:<br>

      <img src="Null_3_35.jpg" alt="Circuit from Null textbook"></li>

      <li> Write a Boolean expression describing the circuit shown above.  Your expression should describe the
         circuit as drawn (i.e., don't simplify it).</li>

      <li>Now write a simplified Boolean expression based on the truth table.</li>


      <li> (<em>From Null, Chapter 3, number 42</em>.) Little Susie is
      building a dog-training robots she calls CESAR (Canine Education
      Special Assistant Robot).  Currently, she is working on the
      robot unit that will award treats when training puppies.  First
      she needs to figure out when a puppy should get dog biscuit as a
      reward; then she can build the appropriate circuit for the
      robot.  She has concluded the following:

      <ul>
	<li> Give the puppy a biscuit if it sits and wiggles but does
	not bark.</li>
	<li> Give the puppy a biscuit if it bars an wiggles but does
	not sit.
	<li> Give the puppy a biscuit if it sits but does not wiggle
	or bark.</li>
	<li> Give the puppy a biscuit if it sits, wiggles and
	barks.</li>
	<li> Don't give the puppy a biscuit otherwise.</li>
	</ul>

	Assume the following variables and values:

	<ul>
	  <li> S: Sit (0 for not sitting; 1 for sitting)
	  <li> W: Wiggles (0 for not wiggling; 1 for wiggling)
	  <li> B: Barking (0 for not barking; 1 for barking)
	  <li> F: Biscuit function (0, don't give the puppy a biscuit
	  1, give the poppy a biscuit)
	  </ul>

	  Construct a truth table, find a minimized Boolean function
	  to implement the logic, then draw the logic diagram.  </li>
	  </ol>

<hr>
The following problems will not be graded:

<ol>

  <li> Book exercises 1.1 - 1.28.  (These are actually just one big
  matching problem.  Use this exercise to make sure you know all the
  terms.)

  <li> Book exercises 1.29 through 1.45.  (Again, these are quick.
  Just use them to make sure you understand everything.)

  <li> Book exercise 1.48.  Remember: <b>B</b>ytes are not the same
thing as <b>b</b>its.

  <li> Book exercise 1.56.

  <li> Book exercise 1.57

  </ol>
